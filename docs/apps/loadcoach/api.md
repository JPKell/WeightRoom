# LoadCoach — Public API

**Base path:** `/api/v1` · **Conventions:** [API and Contract Standards](../../standards/api-and-contract-standards.md)
This is the suite's most externally consumed API: IdeaPress and any third-party tool depend on it.
Everything here is additive within v1, and the committed OpenAPI snapshot is diff-checked in CI.

---

## 1. System

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GET /health` | Components: `database`, `provider`, `evidence`, `queue`, `reliability` |
| `GET /version` | Application version, API versions, accepted SetSpec schema versions. **Never authenticated** — negotiation precedes credentials ([ADR-0026 §5](../../adr/0026-local-http-hardening.md)) |
| `GET /system/status` | Queue depth by state/class, oldest queued age, dispatch latency, active executions, residency, telemetry snapshot, starvation counter, circuit breakers |
| `GET /system/telemetry/stream` | SSE telemetry |

## 2. Models and task profiles

| Endpoint | Notes |
|---|---|
| `GET /models` | Registry with declared capabilities, evidence summary, reliability, residency. Every entry also carries `provider_name` and `is_remote` at its top level, under the names §4's response `model` block uses — the registration that served this model's most recent discovery and that registration's **declared** egress class ([ADR-0055](../../adr/0055-loadcoach-registers-providers-by-name-and-kind.md) rule 4, [ADR-0099](../../adr/0099-a-task-profile-may-ask-for-reduced-thinking.md)). `""` and `false` read as *not recorded*: a row discovered before registrations had names keeps the honest defaults its migration gave it, and is never guessed at from the provider kind |
| `POST /models/discover` | Re-discovery through ModelRack; the Models page's **Scan** button posts here |
| `POST /models/{model_ref}/enabled` | `admin`. Body `{"enabled": bool}` — the operator's decision about whether this model may be used at all ([ADR-0118](../../adr/0118-a-discovered-model-can-be-disabled.md)). Separate from `available`, which is the provider's report: a disabled model keeps its row, its evidence and its history, is rejected by routing as `model_disabled`, and is refused rather than substituted when asked for by name |
| `POST /models/{model_ref}/warm` | `write`. Loads a model by enqueuing one small `general.chat` job pinned to it, so admission, residency and eviction stay on the one path that owns them. Returns the `job_id` |
| `GET /models/{model_ref}` | Identity, descriptor, evidence per capability with source, age and `match_state`, reliability, circuit-breaker state. `model_ref` is the local ULID or an unambiguous prefix — **not** the canonical ID, which contains `/`, `:` and `@` and does not survive a path segment ([ADR-0024](../../adr/0024-canonical-id-and-model-references.md)) |
| `GET /models?canonical_id=…` | Lookup by identity; `?provider_kind=&provider_model_name=&artifact_digest=` is the exact-triple form |
| `GET /task-profiles` · `GET /task-profiles/{id}` | Definitions with version, weights, constraints, execution and validation policy |
| `GET /adapters` | `read`. Every adapter the configured `[adapters] directory` describes — the directory is the truth and the `adapters` table its projection ([ADR-0061](../../adr/0061-the-adapter-registry-is-a-directory-and-a-manifest.md)) — each with its manifest facts (`name`, `artifact_sha256`, the base it declares and that base's identity confidence, `declared_capabilities`, `data_classification`, which is local only by [ADR-0065](../../adr/0065-an-adapter-is-classified-and-local-only.md)), `available` with its reason, the registrations whose providers hold it now (`registered_on`) or after a restart (`pending_on`), `adapter_id` (its registry row, `null` until a sync has read it), `resident` (each device where a resident base last served it) and `routes` (the 20 newest routing candidates that named it: the decision, its task profile, the rank or the rejection code, and whether it was selected). A row the directory no longer describes is listed with `in_directory: false`, because stored decisions still name it. Beside them: `directory`, `invalid` manifests with their problem, unreviewed `drafts`, and `unmanifested` artifacts. With the directory unset the feature is off: `enabled: false` and a `note` saying which key turns it on — a healthy state, not an error |

## 3. Routing without execution

### `POST /route`

```json
{
  "task": "code.review",
  "estimated_input_tokens": 12000,
  "max_output_tokens": 2048,
  "constraints": {"requires_capabilities": ["structured_output"]},
  "overrides": null
}
```

Returns the full routing explanation ([Routing §8](routing.md)) **without** executing. Errors:
`TASK_PROFILE_NOT_FOUND`, `NO_ELIGIBLE_MODEL` (with every candidate and rejection reason).

This endpoint is the cheapest way to understand the system, and the one to reach for when a decision
looks wrong.

## 4. Synchronous generation

### `POST /generate`

```json
{
  "task": "content.article_draft",
  "system": "You are drafting one section of an article. Follow every hard requirement…",
  "prompt": "Write a 600-word section on local inference privacy.",
  "messages": null,
  "response_format": null,
  "sampling": {"temperature": 0.7, "max_output_tokens": 1200},
  "constraints": {"max_latency_seconds": 120},
  "overrides": {"model": null, "runtime_profile": null, "adapter": null,
                "ignore_residency": false},
  "data_classification": null,
  "priority": {"class": "normal"},
  "tools": null,
  "idempotency_key": "01J9K…"
}
```

`data_classification` is the caller's own declaration — `"public"`, `"internal"` or
`"confidential"` — and it is **optional**. LoadCoach joins it with the classification of any adapter
that serves the request, `max(caller, adapter)` over the ordered vocabulary
([ADR-0065](../../adr/0065-an-adapter-is-classified-and-local-only.md) rule 2), and records the
result as the attempt's `effective_data_classification` and in the detail of any
`adapter_classification_conflict` rejection. Absent — which every 1.0 caller is — it contributes
nothing and the effective classification is the adapter's own, exactly as before; a value outside
the vocabulary is a `VALIDATION_ERROR` rather than a silently ignored field. It never widens
anything: the join can only raise the classification, never lower it, so a caller cannot declare its
way past a refusal.

`sampling` overrides the task profile's `execution` block for this request alone, and is recorded
on the attempt. `temperature` and `max_output_tokens` have always been overridable this way; from
1.1.1 **`think`** is too — `false` asks the provider to suppress reasoning, `true` asks for it, and
absent or `null` sends no control at all, which is byte-for-byte the request a caller sent before
the field existed ([ADR-0099](../../adr/0099-a-task-profile-may-ask-for-reduced-thinking.md)). A
`think` that is neither a boolean nor `null` is a `VALIDATION_ERROR` naming the field rather than a
value quietly passed to a provider. **A request that sets `think` requires `thinking_control` of
every candidate**, on top of whatever the task profile requires, so a candidate whose provider
cannot carry the control is rejected by routing with `capability_unsupported`,
`details.capability = "thinking_control"` and `details.required_by = "request"` — never served a
request whose control quietly evaporated. It is the same rule tools get below, for the same reason.

Exactly one of `prompt` (+ optional `system`) or `messages` is supplied; supplying both is a
`VALIDATION_ERROR`. `messages` is a list of `{"role": "system"|"user"|"assistant"|"tool",
"content": str, "tool_call_id": str|null, "tool_calls": list|null}`.

#### Tools on the request

```json
{
  "task": "tools.agent.local_fast",
  "messages": [
    {"role": "user", "content": "List the files in ./notes."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "",
     "tool_calls": [{"id": "ollama-17052f91-0", "name": "list_dir",
                     "arguments": {"path": "./notes"}}]},
    {"role": "tool", "content": "a.md\nb.md", "tool_call_id": "ollama-17052f91-0"}
  ],
  "tools": [
    {"name": "list_dir",
     "description": "List the entries of a directory inside the workspace.",
     "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"path": {"type": "string"}},
                    "required": ["path"]}}
  ]
}
```

**`tools` offers the model a set of tools; LoadCoach never executes one.** It is a router, not an
executor — ModelRack's spec §14 rule inherited verbatim. A requested call comes back at
`output.tool_calls` and the decision to run it belongs entirely to the caller, which is also the
only party that knows what a tool does.

* **`parameters` is passed to the provider unmodified.** LoadCoach does not validate it against
  JSON Schema, rewrite it, infer one, or reject a keyword it does not recognise — the same rule
  that keeps a caller's response schema out of the router
  ([ADR-0041](../../adr/0041-caller-schemas-do-not-travel-through-a-router.md)). A schema
  carrying vendor keywords survives byte-for-byte.
* **`description` is prompt content and it is the caller's to write.** LoadCoach sends it
  unmodified, exactly as it sends `system` and `prompt` (§4's promise above). It reaches the
  model's context, so a caller that accepts tool descriptions from elsewhere is accepting prompt
  content from elsewhere.
* **A request carrying tools requires `tool_use` of every candidate.** A non-empty `tools` imposes
  the `tool_use` hard constraint on *this request*, on top of whatever the task profile requires,
  so a candidate whose provider has not declared tool calling is rejected by routing with a reason
  rather than served a request whose tools quietly evaporated
  ([ADR-0075](../../adr/0075-a-request-carrying-tools-requires-tool-use-of-every-candidate.md)).
  When nothing survives, the error is `NO_ELIGIBLE_MODEL` and each candidate's rejection is
  `capability_unsupported` with `details.capability = "tool_use"` and
  `details.required_by = "request"` — `"task_profile"` where the profile asked for it. Weights do
  not move: this is a filter, never a score.
* **`tools: []` is `tools: null` is absent.** An empty list offers nothing, so it imposes nothing;
  a caller that computed an empty tool set gets exactly the request it would have sent without the
  field.

#### Tool calls on a message

`tool_calls` on an **assistant** turn replays what the model asked for, so a transcript with tool
turns goes back on the wire as it happened. Each entry is
`{"id": str, "name": str, "arguments": object|str}`: `id` and `name` are non-empty; `arguments` is
the parsed argument object, or the raw text when the model's arguments were not a JSON object —
which is kept rather than smoothed to `{}` so a malformed call stays diagnosable.

The wire's consistency rules, each a `VALIDATION_ERROR` naming the field:

| Refused | Field | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `tool_calls` on a non-assistant turn | `messages[i].tool_calls` | A call is something the model requests, never something sent to it |
| A `tool` turn with no `tool_call_id` | `messages[i].tool_call_id` | Two outstanding calls cannot be matched to their results without it |
| A turn with neither `content` nor `tool_calls` | `messages[i].content` | An empty turn tells the model nothing and costs context to send |
| A `tool_call_id` naming no call in an earlier assistant turn | `messages[i].tool_call_id` | An unmatched id is a caller bug; a provider turns it into a confusing model failure instead |

The first three are ModelRack's own refusals, surfaced here rather than reaching the provider; the
fourth is LoadCoach's, and it is the reason a transcript is checked at the edge rather than at the
model.

**The response carries tool calls twice, in two shapes, and a replaying caller reads the assembled
one.** `output.tool_calls` renders the provider's stream as it arrived — one entry per delta,
carrying `call_index`, `id`, `name` and `arguments_fragment`, so a call whose arguments came in
three deltas is three entries. It is what a caller rendering a call as it streams needs, and it is
what `POST /generate/stream`'s `tool_call` frames carry. **`output.tool_calls_assembled`** (from
1.1) carries one entry per call — `id`, `name`, `arguments` — in exactly the shape the request body
accepts, so replaying a turn is a copy rather than a computation. The grouping rule (by `id`, or by
`call_index` where the provider sent none, concatenating `arguments_fragment` in arrival order) now
describes how the server relates the two fields; it is no longer an algorithm each caller must
implement, and the first caller that had to got it wrong against a real model.

`output.tool_calls` is **superseded** by `output.tool_calls_assembled` for replay, and is removed in
LoadCoach `2.0` ([ADR-0078](../../adr/0078-a-shipped-response-field-is-superseded-beside-its-replacement.md)).
It is supported, populated and tested until then: superseded says which field a new caller should
read, not that this one is about to stop working.

**LoadCoach sends the caller's text to the provider unmodified.** It does not prepend a system prompt
of its own, does not substitute the task profile's wording, and does not rewrite the request. The only
prompt records it applies are the ones it originates — the structured-output corrective retry and the
circuit-breaker re-probe — and each is recorded on the attempt that used it. A caller whose own
provenance records the hash of what it sent (IdeaPress does) can therefore trust that record.

Response `200`:

```json
{
  "job_id": "01J9K…",
  "status": "completed",
  "output": {"text": "…", "finish_reason": "stop", "structured": null, "tool_calls": [],
             "tool_calls_assembled": []},
  "reasoning": {"available": false, "summary": null, "source": null},
  "model": {"canonical_id": "ollama/qwen3.5:9b-q8_0@sha256:1f3a9c4e2b70",
            "subject_canonical_id": "ollama/qwen3.5:9b-q8_0@sha256:1f3a9c4e2b70",
            "model_ref": "01J9K…",
            "provider_name": "ollama", "provider_kind": "ollama", "is_remote": false,
            "adapter": null,
            "runtime_profile_hash": "8f2c…",
            "served_context": 32768, "served_context_source": "configured",
            "target_gpu_index": 0},

              "flags": ["low_evidence"], "explanation_url": "/api/v1/jobs/01J9K…/explanation"},
  "usage": {"input_tokens": 812, "output_tokens": 1104, "cache_write_tokens": 0,
            "cache_read_tokens": 128, "thinking_tokens": "unsupported"},
  "timing": {"total_ms": 18422, "provider_ms": 18310, "loadcoach_overhead_ms": 112,
             "ttft_ms": 640, "queue_wait_ms": 0},
  "validation": {"performed": false, "passed": null, "attempts": 1, "checks": []},
  "attempts": [{"attempt": 1, "model": "ollama/qwen3.5:9b-q8_0@…", "outcome": "completed"}],
  "degradations": []
}
```

Notes:
* **`output.finish_reason` is the provider's declared reason for stopping**, for the attempt that
  produced the output: `stop`, `length`, `tool_calls`, `content_filter`, `cancelled`, `error` or
  `unknown` (ModelRack's `FinishReason`). It is recorded from the provider, never inferred from
  the text: an answer truncated at the token limit (`length`) and one the model chose to end
  (`stop`) can be the same string with entirely different meanings, and a caller that advances on
  the output must read this field rather than the text to tell them apart. `validation.checks`
  lists every check the task profile's policy ran on that output, in order, with its `kind`
  (`json`, `json_schema`, `required_fields`, `regex`, `length`), `passed` and `detail`; `performed`
  is `false` (and `passed` `null`) when the profile asked for none. Both fields appear identically
  in the job document `GET /jobs/{id}` returns (§5), so a caller reconciling a job it lost track
  of reads the same facts it would have read here.
* `reasoning` is populated **only** when the provider explicitly returns reasoning content or a
  summary; otherwise `available: false`. LoadCoach never synthesizes or infers hidden chain-of-thought.
* `provider_ms` and `loadcoach_overhead_ms` are always reported separately.
* **`usage` carries four disjoint token classes.** `cache_read_tokens` counts tokens the provider
  billed at its cache-hit rate and `cache_write_tokens` those it billed at its cache-creation
  rate; both are excluded from `input_tokens`, so the four never double-count. A class is `0` when
  the provider's protocol could not have billed it — a real count of nothing — and the string
  `"unsupported"` when it was never reported, which is not a number and must not be totalled as
  one ([ADR-0016](../../adr/0016-unavailable-is-not-zero.md) rule 4,
  [ADR-0070](../../adr/0070-an-absent-token-class-is-zero-only-where-the-protocol-cannot-bill-it.md)).
  `input_tokens` and `output_tokens` follow the same rule as the other three, from
  `loadcoach 1.1.3`: `"unsupported"`, never `null`, for an unreported count. This is a deliberate,
  one-time exception inside `/api/v1` to the additive-only rule, made because the surface had no
  external consumer at the time
  ([ADR-0112](../../adr/0112-the-usage-object-spells-unavailable-one-way-inside-api-v1.md),
  superseding [ADR-0105](../../adr/0105-a-shipped-usage-object-keeps-null-until-api-v2.md)); it
  does not license a future breaking change to any other field. The same `usage` object appears in
  the job document `GET /jobs/{id}` returns (§5).
* `idempotency_key` makes a retried POST safe: the same key returns the original job rather than
  creating a second one. Keys are scoped **per caller**, not globally, so two clients cannot collide;
  the caller is the authenticated token's name, or `X-Client-Name` on an unauthenticated loopback
  bind. A key is reserved for `queue.idempotency_ttl_hours` (default 24) and then released, so a key
  reused months later starts new work rather than replaying an old result. On
  `POST /generate/stream`, a repeated key replays the completed job's `result` event rather than
  re-executing.
* A synchronous request that cannot start within its `max_latency_seconds` returns 503
  `INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES` or 429 `QUEUE_FULL` rather than blocking indefinitely.

### `POST /generate/stream`

Same body; `text/event-stream` response:

```text
event: routing      data: {"schema":"event.envelope","schema_version":"1.0",…,"payload":{…}}
event: thinking     data: {"schema":"event.envelope",…,"payload":{"delta": "The user ", "index": 0,…}}
event: token        data: {"delta": "Local ", "index": 0}
event: tool_call    data: {"schema":"event.envelope",…,"payload":{…}}
event: result       data: {"schema":"event.envelope",…,"payload":{…the full response object…}}
```

**`thinking`** (from `loadcoach 1.5.0`, [ADR-0132](../../adr/0132-loadcoach-streams-thinking-deltas-as-their-own-frame.md))
carries one reasoning delta as the provider streams it, before and sometimes between the answer's
`token` frames. `index` counts thinking frames alone, so `token` indices are unchanged. A provider
that streams no reasoning (`openai_compatible`) sends none — never an empty frame — and the whole
reasoning is still in `result.reasoning.summary`, which is also where a reconnecting caller finds
the thinking it missed: like `token`, `thinking` frames are live and not replayed.

Every frame carries the SetSpec event envelope **except** `token`, which is bare — the one documented
exception, taken because a five-field envelope per token is roughly a hundred bytes of overhead on the
hottest path in the suite ([ADR-0025 §3](../../adr/0025-envelope-boundaries.md)).

Terminal event is always `result` or `error`. Reconnection with `Last-Event-ID` replays from the
persisted job events.

## 5. Jobs

| Endpoint | Notes |
|---|---|
| `POST /jobs` | Asynchronous submission; same body as `/generate` plus `class`, `priority`, `max_wait_seconds`, `idempotent`. Returns `202` with the job |
| `GET /jobs` | Filter by state, class, task, model, date; cursor pagination |
| `GET /jobs/{id}` | Full job: state, attempts, routing summary, usage, timings, validation (with its `checks`), degradations, and the output with its `finish_reason` — the same `output` and `validation` shapes as `POST /generate` (§4) |
| `GET /jobs/{id}/stream` | SSE: state changes, tokens and thinking (when streaming was requested; ADR-0132), terminal result |
| `POST /jobs/{id}/cancel` | 202, or 409 `JOB_NOT_CANCELLABLE` |
| `GET /jobs/{id}/explanation` | The complete routing explanation |
| `POST /jobs/{id}/feedback` | Caller feedback (see §6) |

Job events: `job.queued`, `job.leased`, `job.admitted`, `job.waiting_resources`, `job.executing`,
`job.token`, `job.validating`, `job.retrying`, `job.fallback`, `job.completed`, `job.failed`,
`job.cancelled`, `job.degraded`.

**Cancellation of a non-streaming execution.** LoadCoach always calls the provider through
`Provider.stream()` and assembles the response itself, even when the caller asked for
`POST /generate` rather than `/generate/stream`. A non-streaming provider call offers no boundary at
which a cancellation token can take effect, so "cancelled within one chunk" would be unachievable for
exactly the requests most likely to be long. Assembling internally costs nothing — the transport is
the same NDJSON either way — and it makes cancellation, the stream-idle timeout and partial-response
preservation uniform across both endpoints. Where a provider cannot stream
(`ProviderCapabilities.streaming` false), the job records the degradation
`cancellation_deferred_to_completion` so the limit is visible rather than assumed away.

## 6. Feedback

### `POST /jobs/{id}/feedback`

```json
{
  "source": "ideapress",
  "accepted": true,
  "quality_score": 0.8,
  "validation": {"passed": true, "detail": null},
  "edited": false,
  "notes": "used verbatim"
}
```

`source` is set by LoadCoach from the authenticated token's name (or `X-Client-Name` on an
unauthenticated loopback bind) and the body's value is ignored when a token is present, so one caller
cannot overwrite another's feedback; with neither a token nor the header, the body's `source` is used,
and `anonymous` failing that. Idempotent per `(job_id, source)`; a second call from the same
source updates the existing record. Returns `201` with the stored record on a source's first feedback
for a job and `200` on an update; every source's record is also listed under `feedback` in
`GET /jobs/{id}`. Requires `write`. Accepted for any existing job — feedback on a job that has not
run yet is kept and attributed once it has. Feeds the
`reliability_factor` and regression detection ([Routing §11](routing.md)). Never mutates benchmark
evidence — production and benchmark evidence remain separate sources.

## 7. Evidence

| Endpoint | Notes |
|---|---|
| `POST /evidence/import` | Body: a SetSpec `benchmark.evidence_bundle`, or `{"url": "http://127.0.0.1:8765"}` to pull from FreeWeight. Returns counts imported / updated / **unmatched** / rejected with reasons. The URL form obeys the fetch allowlist in [ADR-0026 §3](../../adr/0026-local-http-hardening.md) — scheme, `evidence.allowed_source_hosts` (loopback only by default), literal-IP, redirect and size checks — and returns `EVIDENCE_SOURCE_REFUSED` when a URL fails them. Before any evidence is read it also negotiates FreeWeight's `GET /version` (ADR-0013), cached with a TTL; a served-majors list excluding `v1`, or a FreeWeight too old to serve `/version` at all (404), is refused with `API_VERSION_UNSUPPORTED` naming both versions |
| `GET /evidence` | Imported evidence, filterable by capability, model, `match_state`, minimum confidence, staleness. A **collection** envelope (`items`/`page`) whose items are `capability.evidence` SetSpec envelopes ([ADR-0025 §2](../../adr/0025-envelope-boundaries.md)), plus a `summary` object — the same store overview `GET /evidence/sources`, the Benchmarks page, `/health`'s `evidence` component and every routing explanation carry, so the four cannot disagree |
| `GET /evidence/sources` | Configured and observed sources with last import time, schema version and status |
| `GET /reliability` | Production evidence per (model, task profile): the `7d`, `30d` and `all` window statistics, each value with the sample count behind it and a reason when absent; the `reliability_factor` routing applies with its inputs; the regression verdict against the model's own baseline; and the circuit breaker's persisted state. Filter by `task` and `model` |

An unsupported schema major is rejected with `SCHEMA_VERSION_UNSUPPORTED` naming both versions;
existing evidence is untouched — the version is decided *before* the transaction opens, so a
rejected bundle cannot have written a source row, let alone a record. Import is `admin`-scoped.

`summary.status` is one of `not_configured`, `none`, `ok`, `unreachable`, `refused`, `incompatible`
or `failed`, and `summary.note` says the same thing in a sentence. `not_configured` (`[evidence]
freeweight_url` is empty) is a **healthy** state and reads differently from `unreachable`: the
first means nobody asked for evidence, the second means the last import is retained and marked
stale while routing continues on it.

Import never fails because a model has not been discovered. Evidence for an unknown model, or
`name_only` evidence against a locally-digested model, is **retained** with a `match_state` and
counted separately in the response; it is bound automatically when discovery next produces a match,
and it never contributes to a routing score until it is
([ADR-0022 §4](../../adr/0022-capability-evidence-record-contract.md)).

## 8. Queue

| Endpoint | Notes |
|---|---|
| `GET /queue` | Depth by state and class, oldest queued age, dispatch latency, starvation counter |
| `POST /queue/pause` · `POST /queue/resume` | Admin: stop or resume dispatch without dropping jobs |
| `POST /queue/drain` | Admin: finish in-flight work and stop claiming new jobs (for a clean shutdown) |

## 9. Settings

`GET /settings`, `PUT /settings` — runtime-changeable settings only. Security-relevant keys are
config-only and return 403 `FORBIDDEN` naming the key.

The runtime-changeable set is a registry (`loadcoach.services.settings.RUNTIME_SETTINGS`), shared by
the API, the Settings page and the scheduler that applies a change within a second: `queue.paused`,
`queue.draining`, `routing.prefer_resident_bonus`, `routing.min_present_weight`,
`routing.min_confidence`, `routing.remote_cost_factor`, `storage.content_retention_hours`. `GET`
returns every key's effective value, its definition and bounds, the configured value it overrides,
and the list of config-only keys. A key that is neither runtime-changeable nor security-relevant is
`400 VALIDATION_ERROR` naming it and listing the set. `PUT` is `admin`-scoped.

Precedence is the standard's (configuration standards §7): `defaults → file → database → env →
CLI`. A stored row is ignored while the environment pins its key, and the row is kept rather than
deleted — unsetting the variable makes it effective again. Each entry in `definitions` therefore
carries, besides `type`, `description`, `minimum`, `maximum` and `configured`: `stored` (the row,
or `null`), `source` (`"database"` when the row is what the process is running on, else
`"configuration"`) and `shadowed_by` (`"env LOADCOACH_…"` naming the variable that beats the row,
else `null`). `queue.paused` and `queue.draining` have no configured counterpart at all — a
`LOADCOACH_QUEUE__PAUSED` variable is refused by the loader as an unknown key — so their stored
row is always the effective value, and they have no row in `docs/configuration.md`
([ADR-0101](../../adr/0101-a-runtime-setting-need-not-be-a-configuration-key.md)).

## 9.1 Providers

`GET /providers`, `PUT /providers/{name}`, `DELETE /providers/{name}` — the
`[providers.<name>]` registrations, read from and written to the configuration file itself
([ADR-0117](../../adr/0117-provider-registrations-are-edited-in-place-in-the-config-file.md)).

`GET` is `read` and returns every registration, the file they live in, that file's digest, and
`shadowed_by` — the `LOADCOACH_PROVIDERS__*` variable, if any, that beats the file for that
registration. `PUT` and `DELETE` are `admin`.

A write edits **only** the provider tables: the file is round-tripped with comments, key order and
formatting intact, the candidate document is validated by loading it through the ordinary
precedence chain, the previous file is kept as `config.toml.bak`, and the running server rebuilds
its provider handles so the change is live without a restart. Nothing else this process read at
startup is re-read.

`enabled` (default `true`) is one of the writable keys. Writing `false` keeps the block in the
file and takes the registration out of the registry: no provider handle is built for it,
discovery never lists it, routing cannot reach it, and every model it last served answers
`available = false` with `unavailable_reason = "provider_disabled"` on the next discovery pass.
Writing `true` again brings them back on the pass after it, with no other action.

Refusals: `400 VALIDATION_ERROR` names a key outside the registration — `allow_remote` included,
because the egress boundary stays config-only — or a value the registration model rejects;
`409 CONFLICT` means the file changed since `base_digest` was read, and nothing was written; the
last remaining registration cannot be deleted, and the last **enabled** registration cannot be
disabled — both would leave the application with no provider at all.

## 10. Errors

Standard envelope. Codes as listed in the [spec §13](spec.md), with these presentation rules:

* `NO_ELIGIBLE_MODEL` always includes every candidate and its rejection reason in `details`.
* `INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES` includes the estimate and what was free.
* `VALIDATION_FAILED` includes the failing field paths and the attempt count.
* `ALL_CANDIDATES_FAILED` includes each attempt with its model and error.
* `VALIDATION_ERROR` includes `details.fields`, a list of `{"path", "problem"}` — the same shape
  whether the body failed the schema or failed one of §4's transcript rules, so a caller reads one
  place for the field that was wrong.
* `ADAPTER_NOT_FOUND` names the adapter the request pinned and lists the adapter names the
  selected provider actually holds. A pin is an assertion, so it fails loudly rather than falling
  back to the bare base ([ADR-0064](../../adr/0064-adapters-are-selected-through-the-capability-vocabulary.md)
  rule 4).
* `PROFILE_MISMATCH` means the resolved runtime profile does not describe the server that would
  serve it ([ADR-0074](../../adr/0074-adapter-enabled-serving-is-a-runtime-profile-field.md)). It is
  **permanent for the request as written** — an identical retry changes nothing — so it is never
  retried and never triggers a fallback, and it belongs with `ADAPTER_NOT_FOUND` rather than with a
  transient provider failure. Seeing one is a LoadCoach defect, not an operator error: LoadCoach
  sets `adapters_registered` from what it handed the provider, so it should never earn this refusal.
* **A request refused while an attempt is being built fails the job with its attempts written.**
  A transcript LoadCoach itself assembles — the structured-output corrective retry — can be
  refused by ModelRack before any provider is called. The job becomes `failed` with
  `error_code = VALIDATION_ERROR`; the attempts already made are persisted with their
  `finish_reason`, so the answer that caused the corrective is readable afterwards. It is not a
  provider failure and not a routing failure: no candidate was rejected and no provider was
  reached. The job never stays `executing` waiting for a watchdog.

## 11. Authentication

Loopback with no tokens: open. Otherwise `Authorization: Bearer <token>` with scopes:

Scopes are **cumulative**: `admin` ⊃ `write` ⊃ `read`. A token carries one scope, and holding it
grants every scope beneath it — so a `write` token needs no separate `read` grant to poll the job it
just submitted.

| Scope | Grants |
|---|---|
| `read` | health, status, models, task profiles, jobs (read), explanations, evidence (read), queue (read) |
| `write` | everything `read` grants, plus `/route`, `/generate`, `/jobs`, cancel, feedback |
| `admin` | everything `write` grants, plus settings, evidence import, queue control, token management |

`GET /version` requires no scope at all.

The scope is checked twice, by design (ADR-0014 §5): at the route, from the request's principal, and
again inside every mutating service, which takes the principal as an argument — so an internal caller
that reaches a service directly with a read-scoped principal is refused too.

A browser cannot add `Authorization` to a page navigation, so on a tokened bind the same bearer token
is carried by the `loadcoach_token` cookie (`HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite=Strict`), set once from the
401 page by pasting the token and cleared by `POST /token-cookie/clear`. No account, no password: the
cookie *is* the token, and revoking the token revokes it. **The tokened-bind UI needs HTTPS or
loopback**: both this cookie and the CSRF cookie are `Secure` (the CSRF cookie `__Host`-prefixed
besides), so on a plain-HTTP non-loopback origin the browser stores neither — `POST /token-cookie`
is then refused with `CSRF_FAILED` and pages stay 401. That is the flags working as intended, not a
defect; terminate TLS at the reverse proxy (ADR-0014 §7) rather than weakening them. The API's
`Authorization` header is unaffected, and `serve` warns at startup on a non-loopback bind with no
`trusted_proxies` configured.

Per-token rate limits and queue-depth caps prevent one caller from starving others. The limit is a
token bucket keyed by the credential's digest (by address before authentication): `[server]
rate_limit_burst` (100) requests may arrive at once, then `rate_limit_per_minute` (600) sustained;
at the boundary the caller gets `429 RATE_LIMITED` with a `Retry-After` header, never a dropped
request. Only `/api/v1` is limited and `/version` is exempt. Failed authentications are braked per
address (`failed_auth_per_minute`, 20). **The brake is on the address, whatever it presents**: once
an address has spent its failure budget, every further request from it that minute gets `429` — a
*correct* token included — until the budget refills. It is deliberately not keyed by
`(address, credential)`: a guesser would mint a fresh bucket with every guessed token and the brake
would never fire. Behind a reverse proxy (the standard non-loopback deployment, ADR-0014 §7) every
caller shares the proxy's address, so one stranger's failures would brake everyone: set `[server]
trusted_proxies` to the proxy's networks (CIDRs) and the brake keys on the client address taken from
the last untrusted hop of `X-Forwarded-For`; from any peer not listed there the header is ignored
entirely. The queue cap is `[queue] max_active_per_source` (200):
a source past it is refused with `QUEUE_FULL` naming the source, its active count and the cap.

## 12. Client guidance (IdeaPress and others)

1. `GET /api/v1/version` on first contact; verify the API major; cache with a TTL.
2. Prefer `/generate` for interactive work and `/jobs` for background work.
3. Always send an `idempotency_key` for non-idempotent submissions.
4. Propagate `X-Request-ID` so a trace spans both applications, and set `X-Client-Name` so jobs and
   feedback are attributed to you on an unauthenticated loopback deployment.
5. Treat LoadCoach being unreachable as **degraded**: fall back to a direct provider, or fail the
   stage with a clear message if the user pinned LoadCoach.
6. Send feedback — it is what makes routing improve.
7. Read `routing.flags`: `low_evidence` means the decision was made with little measured evidence, and
   is worth surfacing to a user who is wondering why a model was chosen. `assumed_context` means the
   served context could not be established and was taken from the model's advertised maximum.
   `breaker_state_unavailable` means the decision was made without the serving process's
   circuit-breaker state — a one-shot process such as the CLI has none — so it may name a model
   the running queue is currently excluding as `recently_failing`; decisions from `POST /route`,
   `POST /generate` and queued jobs never carry it.
8. Send `system` and `prompt` (or `messages`) as the text you want the model to see. LoadCoach does
   not modify it, so your own prompt-version provenance stays true.
9. Offer only the tools the caller is actually willing to run. LoadCoach returns the calls a model
   asks for and executes none of them; a definition you send is a tool you have decided to honour,
   and its `description` is prompt content going into the model's context. Replay
   `output.tool_calls_assembled` as the next turn's `tool_calls` (§4); assemble
   `output.tool_calls`' fragments yourself only against a pre-1.1 server (ADR-0078).
