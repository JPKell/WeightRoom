# FreeWeight configuration reference

**Generated from `freeweight.config.Settings` by
`scripts/generate_config_reference.py`.**
Do not edit by hand: CI fails when this file differs from what the model generates.

Precedence, lowest to highest: built-in defaults → `config.toml` → `FREEWEIGHT_*`
environment variables → CLI flags (configuration standards §1). Overriding is per leaf
field, never per section. Database-backed runtime settings sit between the file and the
environment (§7), so a stored value is ignored while the same key is set in the
environment; `freeweight config show` marks what the table decides `(database)` and names
the variable that beats a shadowed row. The file lives at
`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/freeweight/config.toml`; `freeweight config path` prints the resolved
location and `freeweight config init` writes a commented example.

Environment variables spell the key path as `FREEWEIGHT_<SECTION>__<FIELD>`; a list is
comma-separated. Two conveniences exist outside that scheme: `FREEWEIGHT_CONFIG` names
the file and `FREEWEIGHT_DATA_DIR` moves the data directory.

**Runtime-changeable** means the settings page and `PUT /api/v1/settings` may change it
and the change applies to work started from then on. Everything else is read once at
startup. **Config only** keys decide who can reach this machine, what leaves it, or where
its data lives; the settings API refuses them with `FORBIDDEN` (configuration standards
§7).

## `[server]`

Bind address and HTTP-level limits.

| Key | Environment variable | Type | Default | Valid range | Runtime-changeable | Security | Example | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `server.host` | `FREEWEIGHT_SERVER__HOST` | string | `"127.0.0.1"` | — | no — file or environment, then restart | Config only. A non-loopback bind exposes the service beyond this machine (ADR-0026). | `"127.0.0.1"` | Interface to bind. Loopback by default; anything else requires allowed_hosts and auth.tokens (ADR-0026). |
| `server.port` | `FREEWEIGHT_SERVER__PORT` | integer | `8765` | ≥ 1, ≤ 65535 | no — file or environment, then restart | Config only. Part of the bind. | `8765` | TCP port for the web UI and the API. |
| `server.allow_lan_exposure` | `FREEWEIGHT_SERVER__ALLOW_LAN_EXPOSURE` | boolean | `false` | — | no — file or environment, then restart | Config only. The acknowledgement that makes a `0.0.0.0` bind deliberate. | `false` | Acknowledges a deliberate bind to every interface (0.0.0.0). Without it such a bind refuses to start. |
| `server.allowed_hosts` | `FREEWEIGHT_SERVER__ALLOWED_HOSTS` | list of string | `[]` | — | no — file or environment, then restart | Config only. Defends a non-loopback bind against DNS rebinding. | `["bench.local"]` | Host header values accepted on a non-loopback bind, against DNS rebinding. Comma-separated in the environment. |
| `server.request_timeout_seconds` | `FREEWEIGHT_SERVER__REQUEST_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | number | `120.0` | > 0 | no — file or environment, then restart | — | `120.0` | Server-side request timeout. |

## `[storage]`

Database and artifact locations.

| Key | Environment variable | Type | Default | Valid range | Runtime-changeable | Security | Example | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `storage.database_url` | `FREEWEIGHT_STORAGE__DATABASE_URL` | string, optional | unset | — | no — file or environment, then restart | Config only. May carry a PostgreSQL password; redacted by `config show`. | `"sqlite:////var/lib/freeweight/freeweight.sqlite3"` | SQLAlchemy URL. Unset resolves to a SQLite file under the XDG data directory; PostgreSQL is the other supported dialect (ADR-0006). |
| `storage.auto_migrate` | `FREEWEIGHT_STORAGE__AUTO_MIGRATE` | boolean | `true` | — | no — file or environment, then restart | — | `true` | Migrate on startup. Unset means true on SQLite and false on PostgreSQL, where a failed migration cannot be rolled back automatically (database standards §5.1). |
| `storage.artifact_dir` | `FREEWEIGHT_STORAGE__ARTIFACT_DIR` | string, optional | unset | — | no — file or environment, then restart | Config only. Where raw responses and generated code are written. | `"/var/lib/freeweight/artifacts"` | Where run artifacts (raw responses, generated code, exports) are written. Unset resolves under the XDG data directory. |
| `storage.backup_retention` | `FREEWEIGHT_STORAGE__BACKUP_RETENTION` | integer | `5` | ≥ 0 | yes — applies to work started from now on | — | `5` | Automatic pre-migration backups kept before the oldest is rotated away. |
| `storage.statement_timeout_ms` | `FREEWEIGHT_STORAGE__STATEMENT_TIMEOUT_MS` | integer, optional | unset | > 0 | no — file or environment, then restart | — | `30000` | PostgreSQL statement (and lock) timeout. Unset leaves the server default; SQLite uses its own busy timeout, which the engine always sets. |

## `[provider]`

One provider profile — ``[provider]`` itself, or any ``[providers.<name>]`` (ADR-0144).

| Key | Environment variable | Type | Default | Valid range | Runtime-changeable | Security | Example | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `provider.active` | `FREEWEIGHT_PROVIDER__ACTIVE` | string | `"default"` | — | no — file or environment, then restart | Config only. Chooses the provider profile, and so redirects every prompt at once (ADR-0144). | `"default"` | Which provider profile runs, on the [provider] block only (ADR-0144). 'default' is this block itself; any other name must be a [providers.<name>] table. Setting it inside a [providers.<name>] table is refused, because a profile does not choose itself. |
| `provider.kind` | `FREEWEIGHT_PROVIDER__KIND` | string | `"ollama"` | — | no — file or environment, then restart | — | `"ollama"` | Which provider serves the models: ollama, llamacpp, or fake for tests. |
| `provider.base_url` | `FREEWEIGHT_PROVIDER__BASE_URL` | string | `"http://127.0.0.1:11434"` | — | no — file or environment, then restart | Config only. Where prompts are sent. | `"http://127.0.0.1:11434"` | The provider's API endpoint. Ignored by kind='llamacpp'. |

| `provider.model_directory` | `FREEWEIGHT_PROVIDER__MODEL_DIRECTORY` | string | `""` | — | no — file or environment, then restart | — | `"~/ai/models/llm"` | Directory of GGUF weights kind='llamacpp' serves. Required for that kind; there is no default worth guessing, because a wrong directory is a server serving weights nobody asked for. |
| `provider.state_dir` | `FREEWEIGHT_PROVIDER__STATE_DIR` | string | `""` | — | no — file or environment, then restart | — | `""` | Where the llama.cpp supervisor keeps its pid files and digest cache. Empty means <data_dir>/llamacpp. |

| `provider.memory_max_bytes` | `FREEWEIGHT_PROVIDER__MEMORY_MAX_BYTES` | integer, optional | unset | ≥ 1 | no — file or environment, then restart | — | `25769803776` | Host-memory cap for every llama-server this application launches (ADR-0119): the launch runs in a systemd-run user scope with MemoryMax at this value and swap denied, so a server that does not fit is killed rather than swapping the host. llamacpp only; unset launches uncapped. |
| `provider.memory_high_bytes` | `FREEWEIGHT_PROVIDER__MEMORY_HIGH_BYTES` | integer, optional | unset | ≥ 1 | no — file or environment, then restart | — | `23622320128` | The throttle point below memory_max_bytes (MemoryHigh). Requires memory_max_bytes and must be below it. |

## `[providers]`

Cross-provider policy, plus the named provider profiles themselves (ADR-0144).

| Key | Environment variable | Type | Default | Valid range | Runtime-changeable | Security | Example | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `providers.allow_remote` | `FREEWEIGHT_PROVIDERS__ALLOW_REMOTE` | boolean | `false` | — | no — file or environment, then restart | Config only. Lets content leave this machine; one half of the remote opt-in. | `false` | Permit a remote provider at all. One half of the remote-judging opt-in; judge.allow_remote is the other (ADR-0031 §4). |

## `[adapters]`

The operator's LoRA adapter directory (ADR-0061).

| Key | Environment variable | Type | Default | Valid range | Runtime-changeable | Security | Example | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `adapters.directory` | `FREEWEIGHT_ADAPTERS__DIRECTORY` | string | `""` | — | no — file or environment, then restart | — | `""` | Directory holding LoRA artifacts and their reviewed manifests. Empty disables adapters entirely. |

| `runtime.context_size` | `FREEWEIGHT_RUNTIME__CONTEXT_SIZE` | integer, optional | unset | > 0 | no — file or environment, then restart | — | `8192` | Context window to serve, in tokens (Ollama's num_ctx). Unset lets the provider decide and records the served context as assumed. A different value is a different measurement subject (ADR-0023). |
| `runtime.flash_attention` | `FREEWEIGHT_RUNTIME__FLASH_ATTENTION` | boolean, optional | unset | — | no — file or environment, then restart | — | `true` | Launch the server with flash attention. Honoured by provider.kind='llamacpp' only; refused by name under 'ollama', whose setting is daemon-wide (ADR-0120). |
| `runtime.kv_cache_precision` | `FREEWEIGHT_RUNTIME__KV_CACHE_PRECISION` | one of `"f16"`, `"q8_0"`, `"q4_0"`, optional | unset | — | no — file or environment, then restart | — | `"q8_0"` | KV-cache precision: f16, q8_0 or q4_0. llamacpp only; q8_0 and q4_0 require flash_attention = true.
