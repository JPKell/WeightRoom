## 1. System

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GET /health` | Component health (`database`, `provider`, `gpu_telemetry`, `sandbox`, `external_benchmarks`, `prompts`) |
| `GET /version` | Application version, API versions, SetSpec schema versions. **Never authenticated** ([ADR-0026 §5](../../adr/0026-local-http-hardening.md)) |
| `GET /system/status` | Active run, queue depth, telemetry snapshot, threadpool saturation, disk headroom |
| `GET /system/telemetry/stream` | SSE — `telemetry.sampled` events at the configured interval |

## 2. Machines and models

| Endpoint | Notes |
|---|---|
| `GET /machines` · `GET /machines/{id}` | Static profiles; the current machine is flagged. **Never writes** — machines are recorded when a run is created, so polling this cannot make one look freshly used, and the list is legitimately empty before anything has been measured. Each carries `nickname` and `display_name` (below) |
| `PATCH /machines/{machine_id}` | Set or clear the operator's own label for one machine: `{"nickname": "the workstation"}`, or `null` (or blank) to clear it. Answers `{"id", "nickname"}`. `PATCH`, not `PUT`: the nickname is the only writable field of a machine — every other column is measured from the host — and a `PUT` of a partial profile would invite a client to send the measured ones back. The path is the machine's **exact ULID, never a prefix**: a prefix is a convenience on a read, where the wrong match shows the wrong page, and a hazard on a write, where it renames the wrong machine; no match is `404 NOT_FOUND` |
| `GET /models` | Filter by `provider_kind`, `family`, `quantization`, `has_results` (`true` or `false`: whether any of its runs stored a metric) and `min_parameters` / `max_parameters` (the latest descriptor's `parameter_count`, inclusive, in parameters — `8000000000`, not `8`); `sort` is `last_seen_at` or `canonical_id`, with a leading `-` for descending — `-last_seen_at`, the newest sighting first, when omitted; any other `sort` is `400 VALIDATION_ERROR` naming it. Each item carries `display_name` (below), `family`, `enabled` and `has_results` beside its identity |
| `POST /models/discover` | Re-discovers through ModelRack; returns added/updated/unchanged/total counts. The counts, not the models: a client that wants the list asks for it, and a discovery that returned every model would bury *what changed* |
| `POST /models/{model_ref}/enabled` | Disable or enable one model — an operator's decision that this model may not be measured ([ADR-0118](../../adr/0118-a-discovered-model-can-be-disabled.md)). The body is JSON, `{"enabled": true}` or `{"enabled": false}`; the answer is `{"canonical_id", "enabled"}`. The Models page's button posts the same decision as the form field `enabled` to the page's own route, because a form post to `/api/v1` carries no CSRF token and is refused. The row, its descriptors and every result measured under it stay; a new run naming a disabled model is refused by name, and discovery never writes the flag, so a rescan does not undo it |
| `GET /models/{model_ref}` | Identity with `enabled`, latest descriptor, descriptor history. The model's evidence is `GET /evidence?model=…` (§6) |
| `GET /models/{model_ref}/results` | Paginated results for this model, filterable by suite and runtime profile |
| `GET /models?canonical_id=…` | Lookup by identity; `?provider_kind=&provider_model_name=&artifact_digest=` is the exact-triple form |

`model_ref` is the application-local ULID, or an unambiguous prefix of one; an ambiguous prefix
returns 400 listing the candidates. **The canonical ID is never a path segment** — it contains `/`,
`:` and `@`, and a percent-encoded `/` does not survive common reverse proxies
([ADR-0024](../../adr/0024-canonical-id-and-model-references.md)). Request bodies and CLI arguments
still accept a canonical ID, a bare name or an unambiguous prefix.

A machine's **`display_name`** is its `nickname`, else its `hostname`, else its ULID — never a
truncated fingerprint, which reads as an identity and is not one. The full `machine_fingerprint`
travels beside it in every body that carries it, and remains the only thing any measurement is
attributed to: a nickname identifies nothing and nothing resolves a machine by it.

A model's **`display_name`** is what a person should be shown, and it is a property of the *list*, not of a
row. It is the model's `provider_model_name` — the name an operator recognizes — except where two
or more **enabled** models share that name, in which case every model carrying it is displayed by
`canonical_id` instead: a name that names two measurable subjects names neither. It is computed
once over the whole list, never per row and never in a template, because a filtered or paged view
that recomputed it would call a name unique on the strength of the model it collides with having
been filtered out. `GET /models/{model_ref}` answers the list's name for that model, not a second
rule.

A model whose latest descriptor never reported a `parameter_count` is **outside every**
`min_parameters` / `max_parameters` bound, `min_parameters=0` included. An unsupported measurement
is not a number and does not compare as zero
([ADR-0016](../../adr/0016-unsupported-is-not-zero.md)).

## 2a. Adapters

| Endpoint | Notes |
|---|---|
| `POST /adapters/{name}/draft` | Write `<name>.manifest.draft.json` for an artifact the directory holds with no manifest — the console's *Draft manifest* action ([ADR-0145](../../adr/0145-freeweight-drafts-an-adapter-manifest-and-still-trusts-nothing.md)). Body: `base_model_name` (**required** — the one field no reader of a GGUF can establish), optional `declared_capabilities[]` and `notes`. Answers `{"adapter", "path", "payload"}` |
| `GET /adapters` | The LoRA adapters this installation knows: the operator's `[adapters] directory` read once ([ADR-0061](../../adr/0061-the-adapter-registry-is-a-directory-and-a-manifest.md)), joined with FreeWeight's own `adapters` table, which outlives the directory. The same reading `freeweight adapters list --json` prints, plus what was measured |

The body carries `enabled` (whether `[adapters] directory` is set), `directory`, `note` (why the
directory could not be read, or `null`), `provider_can_serve` (whether the configured provider
declares `adapter_hot_swap` at all — `false` means the directory is configured and **inert**, read
and listed and offered to nobody, [ADR-0140](../../adr/0140-adapters-are-inert-under-a-provider-that-cannot-serve-them.md);
`null` only where no provider was asked, which is never the case on this route), `invalid`, `drafts`
and `unmanifested` as the CLI prints them, and `adapters`, keyed by artifact digest. Each adapter is the directory's entry
(`in_directory: true`) or, for an adapter measured once and since removed from the directory, the
table's row (`in_directory: false`, `available: false`). Beside it:

* `run_count` and `last_run_at` — the runs created under it (`GET /runs?adapter=…` lists them);
* `subjects` — one per base it was measured on: `base` (the base's canonical ID), `subject` (the
  adapter subject's canonical ID, `null` until evidence exists for it), `measured` (`{capability_id: score}` measured **on that
  subject**) and `base_measured` (the same, measured on the bare base). The two are reported side
  by side and never merged: an adapter subject inherits nothing from its base
  ([ADR-0059](../../adr/0059-adapter-evidence-is-measured-never-inherited.md)), and an empty
  `measured` is an unmeasured subject, not a score of zero.

With adapters off the answer is still `200`: `enabled: false`, the note naming the key, and the
table's rows, because a measured adapter's history does not disappear when the directory is unset.

**A draft registers nothing.** ADR-0061 rule 4 — *the scan drafts, a human keeps* — and the suffix
is the enforcement: `*.manifest.draft.json` is skipped when the directory's manifests are read, so
a drafted adapter is never an entry, never offered to a provider and never a benchmark subject
until a person has checked it and renamed it to `<name>.manifest.json`. The draft records the
artifact's own SHA-256, which is the identity (rule 5), the base at `name_only` confidence with no
digest — a base digest nobody verified is the misattribution ADR-0061 exists to prevent — and
`data_classification: "confidential"`, the most restrictive value, with a note saying the reviewer
sets it ([ADR-0065](../../adr/0065-an-adapter-is-classified-and-local-only.md) gives it no default
precisely so a person chooses). `409 DRAFT_REFUSED` when the name is not one path segment, when
there is no such unmanifested artifact, when a manifest or draft is already there — an existing
draft is never overwritten, because what that would destroy is a person's review — and when
`[adapters] directory` is empty, which is a request this route refuses and not a fault in the
server.

## 3. Benchmarks

| Endpoint | Notes |
|---|---|
| `GET /benchmarks` | Installed suites with version, category, runner, requirements, dataset hashes, `headline_metric` and test count. Read from the registry the **run engine executes from**, so a suite listed here is one `POST /runs` accepts — a listing assembled separately would eventually disagree |
| `GET /benchmarks/{key}` | Manifest, tests, metric definitions, prompt references, dataset hashes. `404` names what *is* installed |

## 3a. Goals (user-authored suites)

Full contract: [Subjective Goals](subjective-goals.md).
Decisions: [ADR-0031](../../adr/0031-user-defined-goal-benchmarks.md),
[ADR-0032](../../adr/0032-judge-validity-and-user-capability-namespace.md).

| Endpoint | Notes |
|---|---|
| `GET /goals` | Goals with `goal_hash`, `score_method_mix`, `calibration_state` (`uncalibrated` \| `insufficient` \| `calibrated`), `kappa_w`, `n_holdout`, `calibrated_at` (the stored report's `measured_at`: the calibration's age), `calibration_stale` (the stored report was measured against another `goal_hash`), `unforked`. The state comes from the stored report; a goal with no report is `insufficient` when it has judged criteria and `calibrated` when it has none, with `kappa_w`, `n_holdout` and `calibrated_at` `null` |
| `POST /goals` | Create from a goal-pack body. Validates and lints before writing; a lint finding never blocks creation, it is returned |
| `GET /goals/{slug}` | The full pack as loaded, plus lint findings and the current calibration report. `pack` is `{"goal", "tasks"}` — `goal.json` and each task's prompt record exactly as they are on disk, which is the body `PUT` takes — and `calibration` is `GET …/calibration/report`'s body, or `null` for a goal never calibrated |
| `PUT /goals/{slug}` | Replace. Returns the **old and new `goal_hash`** and, when they differ, the count of existing runs the change separates — before the change is committed. `?dry_run=true` builds and validates the replacement, reports the same, and writes nothing. A replacement rewrites `goal.json` and `tasks/`; every other file in the pack — a judge rubric under `prompts/`, calibration files, `pack.json` — is carried over as it was |
| `DELETE /goals/{slug}` | Previewed like every destructive operation; the preview states how many runs it orphans and how many of the user's grades it destroys |
| `POST /goals/{slug}/validate` | Schema, weights, scale descriptors, rule dialect, template rendering. Returns findings with severity |
| `POST /goals/{slug}/suggest-rules` | Given criteria (and calibration samples where present), proposes rung-2 rules with pre-filled parameters: `proposals` (`{criterion: [rule_type, …]}`) and `items`, one per proposal with `criterion`, `rule_type`, `parameters` and `explanation`. **Proposals only** — never applied automatically |
| `GET /goals/{slug}/tasks` | The task set, flagged `is_starter` |
| `GET /goals/{slug}/calibration` | Samples with partition, grade progress, and what remains to be graded |
| `GET /goals/{slug}/calibration/grading` | The blinded grading view FreeWeight's own grading screen renders: `criteria` to grade (judged and human) with `name`, `scale_points` and `descriptors`; `samples` in a stable per-goal shuffle, each `sample_id`, `content` and the grades recorded so far (`{criterion: {"grade", "note"}}`); `progress`. It never carries a sample's origin, its partition, the model that wrote it, or any jury grade |
| `POST /goals/{slug}/calibration/samples` | Add samples: paste text, or promote prior run samples. An entry with `source_sample_id` promotes a completed sample of a run of **this** goal: FreeWeight reads the response text it stored, records `origin: "imported_run_sample"` and the run's model, and refuses (`400`) a sample that is not one, or a `content` that differs from what it stored. Generation over a model spread is composed from runs: run the goal on each model, then promote their samples |
| `POST /goals/{slug}/calibration/grades` | Submit grades. Idempotent per `(sample, criterion)`; partial submission is normal and progress survives interruption |
| `POST /goals/{slug}/calibration/run` | Score the **holdout** with the configured jury and compute agreement. **Synchronous**: the request lasts as long as the jury does and answers with the report. No run is created and nothing streams — `freeweight goals calibrate <slug> --progress` prints one JSON line per holdout sample as the jury grades it, which is how a console follows a calibration live |
| `GET /goals/{slug}/calibration/report` | `kappa_w`, `rho`, `mae`, `bias`, `n_anchor`, `n_holdout`, inter-juror alpha, per criterion and weighted; gate verdict; `judge_validity_factor`; the worst-diverging holdout samples with both rationales. `n_holdout` is the samples a coefficient was **counted** over; beside it, `n_judged` (goal-level and per criterion) is how many the jury actually judged, and `excluded` names every judged sample not counted, with why (`self_judging`, `protocol_error`, `output_truncated`, `timeout`, `unparsed_grade`, or `not_graded_by_author` — `output_truncated` is a juror that hit its output limit without ever reaching an answer, which is a different event from `protocol_error`'s juror that answered something unusable, ADR-0141; the report's `warnings` then carry a sentence naming the setting that bounded it — `runtime.context_size` when no `[judge] max_output_tokens` is set, since the prompt and the answer share the served window, else the budget) — `n_judged` equals `n_holdout` and `excluded` is empty when nothing was dropped |
| `GET /goals/{slug}/calibration/report/export` | The same report as a `benchmark.calibration_report` SetSpec envelope; refused for a goal never calibrated. **Narrower than the report**: `criteria` carries only the criteria for which both `kappa_w` and `rho` were computed — the wire schema requires both, and a coefficient that could not be computed is never fabricated as a number (Subjective Goals §5.4). A criterion the report page shows with a `null` `rho` (too few counted samples, or one side with no variance) is present on `GET .../calibration/report` and absent here; it is not lost, it is off the exportable contract until a coefficient exists for it |
| `GET /goals/{slug}/export` | `benchmark.goal_pack` — a single SetSpec envelope describing the pack. **Not** the round-trip format: `POST /goals/import` reads the *bundle* that `freeweight goals export` writes ([spec §7.3](spec.md)) |
| `GET /goals/{slug}/bundle` | The bundle itself, byte for byte what `freeweight goals export` writes, as an attachment — the round-trip form `POST /goals/import` reads |
| `POST /goals/import` | Import a pack. Size-capped, containment-checked, schema-validated, hash-verified before any write; **never overwrites in place** — a colliding slug is rejected with the existing `goal_hash` named |
| `GET /goals/starters` | The four shipped starter packs with their approximate deterministic weight |
| `POST /goals/starters/{key}/fork` | Copy a starter to a new slug. The copy is `unforked` until its criteria or tasks are edited |
| `GET /goals/drafts` | The authoring wizard's drafts still live, most recently changed first: `draft_id`, `name`, `slug`, `step`, `forked_from`, `saved_slug`, `created_at`, `updated_at`, `expires_at`. A draft untouched for 30 days has expired and is not listed; listing removes it |
| `POST /goals/drafts` | Begin a draft: `{"intent", "name"}` is the wizard's step 1; `{"starter": key}` customises a starter, its criteria and tasks arriving as drafts with every task `is_starter`. `201` with the draft |
| `GET /goals/drafts/{draft_id}` | One draft with what each wizard step shows: `questions` (step 2's two), each criterion's `needs_descriptors` and `needs_attention`, `proposals` (step 3, each `accepted` or not), `weight_shift` (`deterministic`, `judged`, `sentence`) and `grading_cost`. `404` for an unknown or expired draft |
| `POST /goals/drafts/{draft_id}/criteria` | One step-2 action: `{"action": "add", "name", "intent"}`, `{"action": "answer", "criterion", "graded_alike", "one_quality"}` (each `true`, `false` or `null` for unanswered), `{"action": "describe", "criterion", "points", "top", "middle", "bottom"}`, or `{"action": "split", "criterion", "first", "second"}`. Answers the draft |
| `POST /goals/drafts/{draft_id}/rules` | Accept one proposed rule: `{"criterion", "rule_type", "parameters"}`, `parameters` `null` for the pre-filled ones. The only way a draft's criterion moves to a rule |
| `POST /goals/drafts/{draft_id}/tasks` | Add a task: `{"name", "prompt_text"}` |
| `POST /goals/drafts/{draft_id}/save` | Write the pack: `{"slug", "name"}`, either blank for the draft's own. Answers `{"draft", "goal"}`; a draft already saved answers the pack it wrote rather than writing a second |
| `DELETE /goals/drafts/{draft_id}` | Abandon a draft. `204` |
| `GET /judges` | Models eligible to serve as jurors, each with its own `native.judge` bias results and eligibility reasons. `judge_results` is the model's latest completed `native.judge` run — `run_id`, `created_at` and `metrics`, one entry per figure that characterises a juror (pairwise accuracy, swap consistency, the position, repetition, verbosity and style rates, transitivity violations, self-preference), `null` where that run reported none — or `null` for a model never measured as a judge |
| `POST /judges/validate` | Dry-run a jury configuration: assembly, self-judging conflicts, remote permission, structured-output capability |

Two behaviours worth stating at the API level, because a client will otherwise get them wrong:

* **A goal below the gate is a `200`, not an error.** The run completes, results are returned in
  full, `calibration_state` is `"uncalibrated"`, and `GET /evidence` simply contains nothing for that
  capability. `CALIBRATION_INSUFFICIENT` is a `409` and means something different: fewer than
  `min_samples` grades exist, so agreement has never been measured at all.
* **`PUT /goals/{slug}` is a separating change when `goal_hash` moves.** The response says so with a
  count, and a client that applies the change without surfacing it will silently fragment a user's
  measurement history.

## 4. Runs

### `POST /runs`

```json
{
  "model": "ollama/qwen3.5:9b-q8_0",
  "suites": ["native.performance", "native.tool_use"],
  "tests": null,
  "runtime": {"context_size": 32768},
  "adapter": null,
  "gpu_index": 0,
  "execution": {"measured_repetitions": 3, "warmup_repetitions": 1,
                "test_timeout_seconds": 600, "seed": 42, "store_prompts": false},
  "sampling": {"temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_output_tokens": 1024},
  "label": "q8 baseline"
}
```

Response `201` with the run object, including `reproducibility_fingerprint` and the resolved
`effective_config`. Validation happens before the run is persisted, so a rejected request creates
nothing.

`runtime` overrides the `[runtime]` configuration section **for this run**, field by field — the
fields it omits keep their configured values. It accepts `context_size`, `gpu_layers`, `threads`,
`batch_size`, `keep_alive`, `flash_attention`, `kv_cache_precision` and `fit_to_device`; an
unrecognised key is a `VALIDATION_ERROR` naming it rather than a silently ignored one, because a
runtime setting that is accepted and not applied produces a run whose record describes conditions
it was never served under. `flash_attention` and `kv_cache_precision` under `provider.kind =
"ollama"` are a `CONFIGURATION_ERROR` naming the key for the same reason (ADR-0120 rule 4). Every field set here is hashed into
`runtime_profile_hash` and therefore separates results
([ADR-0023](../../adr/0023-runtime-profile-resolution.md)).

`adapter` names a registered LoRA from `[adapters] directory` to serve the base with, exactly as
`run start --adapter` does. It makes the run a measurement of a **different subject**
([ADR-0058](../../adr/0058-the-execution-subject-gains-an-adapter-axis.md)), and an adapter that is
unknown, unavailable, not applicable to this base, or on a provider that cannot apply one is a
`VALIDATION_ERROR` naming it and listing the registered set — never a run of the bare base under
the adapter's name. `null` or absent is the bare base, which is what every run before Phase 15 was.

`POST /runs/{id}/repeat` reuses the **original run's stored profile**, not the current
configuration, **and the original's adapter**: a repeat of an adapter run measures the same
`(base, adapter)` subject, and one whose adapter is no longer servable is refused by name rather
than falling back to the base.

Notable errors: `MODEL_NOT_FOUND`, `BENCHMARK_NOT_FOUND`, `DATASET_MISSING`,
`DATASET_HASH_MISMATCH`, `PROVIDER_UNAVAILABLE`, `INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES`, `RUN_ALREADY_RUNNING`
(when a GPU workload is active and queueing is disabled), `SANDBOX_UNAVAILABLE` (only when every
selected test requires a sandbox).

| Endpoint | Notes |
|---|---|
| `GET /runs` | Filter by `status`, `model` (canonical ID, ULID, unambiguous prefix or provider name), `suite`, `machine` (fingerprint), `label` (exact), `adapter` (name or artifact digest) and `since`/`until` (RFC 3339 on creation time, half-open as the export's window is); newest first, `limit` (default 50, at most 500) and `cursor`. The body is `runs` plus `page` (`limit`, `next_cursor`, `has_more`); each run names its `machine_fingerprint`, `runtime_profile_hash` and `adapter` (`null` for a bare base) |
| `GET /runs/{id}` | Run with tests, aggregate metrics, degradations and the fingerprint document. A metric row names its key `metric_key`, as every other surface does (§11) |
| `POST /runs/{id}/cancel` | 202 when accepted; 409 `RUN_NOT_CANCELLABLE` for terminal runs |
| `POST /runs/{id}/repeat` | Creates a new run with the identical effective config, reusing the original's frozen `ExecutionConfig`, runtime profile and adapter rather than re-resolving them; `?force=true` proceeds past a blocker and records the divergence; `?label=` names the new run |
| `GET /runs/{id}/events` | SSE with `Last-Event-ID` replay |
| `GET /runs/{id}/tests` · `GET /runs/{id}/tests/{test_id}/samples` | Drill-down. Samples come in `(ordinal, repetition)` order with `limit` (default 500, at most 1000) and `cursor`; the body is `samples` plus `page`, and each sample names `prompt_id`, `prompt_version` and `client_ttft_ms` beside its score |
| `GET /runs/{id}/telemetry` | The run's persisted telemetry as parallel series for a chart: `timestamps`, `cpu_percent`, `ram_used_bytes`, and `gpus`, one entry per device with `utilization_percent`, `vram_used_bytes`, `power_watts` and `temperature_c`. Every series shares the timestamps' index; a `null` is a reading this machine could not take at that instant — a gap, never a zero ([ADR-0016](../../adr/0016-unavailable-is-not-zero.md)). Empty series for a run that recorded none |
| `GET /runs/{id}/grading` | The blinded grading view of a completed goal run's `human` criteria (Subjective Goals §3.3), what FreeWeight's `/runs/{id}/grade` screen renders: `goal_slug`, `goal_name`, `criteria` with `name`, `weight`, `scale_points` and `descriptors`, `samples` in a seeded order that is not the order they were produced in — each `sample_id`, `case_id`, `response_text` and the grades so far — and `expected_grades`, `recorded_grades`, `complete`. The model is never read. `409 RUN_NOT_GRADEABLE` names why a run cannot be graded: not a goal run, not completed, no human criterion, or a rubric changed since |
| `POST /runs/{id}/grades` | `{"grades": [{"sample_id", "criterion", "grade", "note"}], "graded_by"}`, upserted per `(sample, criterion)`. Each graded sample's composite, the run's aggregate metrics and the subject's capability evidence are recomputed before the answer, which is the view's progress and `recorded` |
| `GET /samples/{sample_id}` | The case inspector: one sample exactly as recorded — prompt identity and hashes, the response (when the run stored it), score and method, tokens and timings, the scorer's `result`, `tool_calls`, `criterion_scores` with each juror's `verdicts`, and the `telemetry` observations inside the sample's reconstructed window — with its `run_id`, `run_status`, `run_test_id` and `run_test_key`. `404 NOT_FOUND` for an unknown id |

### Run events

## 5. Results and comparison

| Endpoint | Notes |
|---|---|
| `GET /results` | Metric-level query: filter by model, suite, metric key, machine, runtime profile, `adapter` (name or artifact digest: only runs measured under it), date |
| `GET /results/compare` | `?subjects=a,b,c&suite=…` — aligned metrics with comparability verdicts and, where a comparison is not permitted, the reason |
| `GET /results/export` | `?format=json|jsonl|csv&scope=run|model|suite|comparison|all&include_samples=…&include_prompts=…&include_prompt_text=…&since=…&until=…` — streams; JSON/JSONL are wrapped in a `freeweight.export` envelope (§12) |
| `GET /results/context-fit` | How much context fit, per model, runtime profile and machine — the `native.context_fit` fold, below |

The compare endpoint never averages across a boundary marked "separate"; it returns the groups and
the field-level fingerprint diff that separates them.

**A comparison of one model at three or more served contexts carries a `context_sweep`.** Not
requested — derived: a user who has run the same model at several `context_size` values has already
produced the measurement, and this is the surface that notices. It differences each run's
`model_vram_bytes` into a cost function, `weights_bytes + bytes_per_token × context`, with the `r²`
of the fit beside it so a sweep taken on a busy GPU shows rather than quietly biasing the slope.
`null` for every other comparison, which is the ordinary case.

This is a **study across runs**, not a benchmark result, and it cannot be either the other way
round: `size_vram` scales with the context a model was *loaded* at, so a sweep of prompt lengths
inside one run measures KV fill rather than KV cost, and a benchmark is one run under one profile
([ADR-0034 §6](../../adr/0034-run-level-derived-metrics.md)).

`subjects` accepts **either** a run reference or a model reference. A run subject is guarded by
`suite`: naming a run of a different suite is refused by name. A *model* subject requires `suite`,
and resolves to that model's latest completed run of it — naming a model with no `suite` is
`VALIDATION_ERROR`, because "latest" would otherwise mean something different per subject.

`GET /results/export` refuses a selection wider than **500 runs** rather than truncating one. A
truncated export that did not say it was truncated would be a lie about what was measured, and the
document has no pagination because it is a document, not a page. The refusal names the count and
points at the window.

**`since` and `until` bound the export by run creation time, and the window is half-open** —
`[since, until)`. That is what makes windowing *complete* rather than merely smaller: a run created
exactly at the boundary belongs to the window that starts there and not to the one that ends there,
so consecutive windows tile without duplicating a run or dropping one between them. A history
larger than one document is therefore exported as several that reassemble exactly. Every document
states the window it covers, so a reader can tell a slice from a whole.

**`include_prompts=true` exports prompt *identity*** — each sample's `prompt_id`,
`prompt_version`, `prompt_hash` and `rendered_prompt_hash`. That is the right default: a database of
measurements should not become a second copy of the prompt pack, and [prompt standards
§4](../../standards/prompt-management-standards.md) makes the identity sufficient to re-render —
*on the machine that has the pack*. A reader elsewhere does not, which is the difference between an
export that is auditable and one that is merely referential.

**`include_prompt_text=true` closes that gap** with a **prompt appendix**: each distinct rendered
prompt once, keyed by its `rendered_prompt_hash`, under `payload.prompt_appendix`. Cheap, because
prompts repeat across thousands of samples. It is built by **re-rendering** from the installed
suites rather than by reading stored text — prompt text is not stored — so it also *verifies*: a
prompt offered under a given hash is one whose current text produces that hash. A prompt edited
since the run simply does not appear, and the reader gets no text rather than the wrong text.

### `GET /results/context-fit`

Additive, read-only, no parameters. The latest `native.context_fit` reading per **(model, runtime
profile, machine)**: `max_successful_context_tokens`, `capped_by_configuration`,
`observed_mb_per_1k_context`, with the `run_id` and `measured_at` they came from. Added for the
console (row WX7) and read by LoadCoach's models page through it (row WX9). It read
`native.memory_kv` until ADR-0148, whose suite serves each rung at its own context;
`observed_mb_per_1k_context` is `null` there, because that suite fits no slope.
`usable_context_tokens` is the fit less one 4 096-token step — the context FreeWeight's benchmarks
run at and the number the console applies to LoadCoach (ADR-0152); `null` when nothing served.

```json
{"items": [
  {"model": "ollama/qwen3:8b@sha256:…", "runtime_profile_hash": "…", "machine_fingerprint": "…",
   "max_successful_context_tokens": 32768.0, "usable_context_tokens": 28672, "capped_by_configuration": true,
   "observed_mb_per_1k_context": 61.4, "run_id": "…", "measured_at": "2026-09-11T09:00:00Z"}
]}
```

The three keys are reported **together and never apart**, and the key is a triple rather than a
model, for two reasons the metric query cannot express on its own:

* `max_successful_context_tokens` alone is ambiguous by construction. The same number means "the
  model refused at the next rung" and "the sweep was told not to climb further", and
  `capped_by_configuration` (`true` for the second) is the only thing that says which.
* A context figure without the runtime profile it was measured under is a claim about the model
  that is really a claim about the configuration — and memory figures never cross a machine
  ([ADR-0027](../../adr/0027-comparability-is-a-matrix-not-a-boolean.md) §5). One number per model
  would be a lie; a consumer showing one picks a profile and says which.

Latest run wins per key, never an average: two sweeps under different profiles are two facts.
`"unsupported"`, never `0`, for a figure the run could not establish (ADR-0016 §4), and
`capped_by_configuration` is `null` where the run did not say. An installation that has never run
`native.memory_kv` answers `{"items": []}` — an absence of measurement, which the caller reports
as unmeasured.

## 5a. Dashboard

| Endpoint | Notes |
|---|---|
| `GET /dashboard` | Additive, read-only. The summary cards and the comparison heatmap `GET /dashboard` (the HTML page) renders — filter by `suite`, `model`, `machine` and `since`, exactly as the page's own filter bar does |

Added for WeightRoomGym's console (row WPF5): the dashboard is FreeWeight's only cross-model view
(§5's `/results` is a metric-level query and `/results/compare` works per subject), and it was
HTML-only until this endpoint. The route answers only the summary and the heatmap cells, with
FreeWeight's own *separated* marking — the scatter panels and the per-metric panel tables stay
HTML-only, since nothing outside FreeWeight's own page reads them.

```json
{
  "filter": {"suite": null, "model": null, "machine": null, "since": null},
  "cards": {
    "completed_runs": 11, "models_measured": 6, "suites_run": 4, "samples_stored": 375,
    "unsupported_metrics": 60, "machines": 3, "latest_run_at": "2026-09-10T12:00:00Z"
  },
  "heatmap": {
    "models": ["ollama/smollm2:135m@sha256:…"],
    "suites": ["native.echo"],
    "headline_metric": {"native.echo": "harness_roundtrip_success"},
    "separated": false,
    "cells": [
      {"model": "ollama/smollm2:135m@sha256:…", "suite": "native.echo",
       "metric_key": "harness_roundtrip_success", "run_id": "…", "run_test_id": null,
       "value": 0.92, "unavailable_reason": null, "unit": "ratio", "higher_is_better": true,
       "sample_count": 20, "excluded_count": 0, "machine_fingerprint": "…", "suite_version": "1"}
    ]
  }
}
```

The body also carries **`tests_matrix`**, the heatmap's sibling and its opposite question. The
heatmap answers *how good was it*, for the suites a model finished; the matrix answers *what did
it actually run* — which the heatmap cannot, because a suite whose hardest test was skipped for
want of VRAM still shows a headline number and nothing says half of it did not run.

```json
"tests_matrix": {
  "models": ["ollama/smollm2:135m@sha256:…"],
  "tests": ["echo.roundtrip"],
  "cells": [{"model": "ollama/smollm2:135m@sha256:…", "test": "echo.roundtrip",
             "status": "completed", "skip_reason": null, "run_id": "…", "mean_score": 0.92}]
},
"test_metrics": [{"model": "ollama/smollm2:135m@sha256:…", "test": "echo.roundtrip",
                  "metric_key": "harness_roundtrip_success", "value": 0.92, "unit": "ratio",
                  "higher_is_better": true, "run_id": "…"}]
```

`mean_score` is how well a cell did: the mean of that run test's sample scores, a failed sample
counting `0` and a skipped or unscored sample left out. It is `null`, never `0`, when no sample
could be scored. `test_metrics` is every test-level metric row of the same runs — the run-level
roll-ups are the heatmap's — with `value` `"unsupported"` under the same convention as `cells`.

`status` is the `run_tests` row's own: `completed`, `failed`, `skipped` or `cancelled`.
`skip_reason` is present for a skip and required to be (spec §13) — "skipped" without one is
indistinguishable from "nobody got round to it". Scoped to exactly the runs the heatmap draws
from: the latest completed run per (model, suite), under the same filters. Sparse for the same
reason `cells` is, and a missing (model, test) pair is a test that run never recorded, which
renders as an empty cell and never as a status. A model that ran one test key in two of those runs
shows the newer run's outcome — the same "latest run wins" rule the heatmap applies.

`cells` is a sparse list, not a `models × suites` grid: most pairs are unmeasured, and JSON has no
tuple keys. A cell's `value` is the string `"unsupported"`, never `0`, when this machine could not
measure it (ADR-0016 §4) — the same convention `GET /results` uses for `value` and `stddev`.
`separated` marks a heatmap whose cells span more than one machine or more than one version of a
suite; the caller reads it down a column, not across a row, exactly as the HTML page does.

## 6. Evidence (the LoadCoach integration point)

| Endpoint | Notes |
|---|---|
| `GET /evidence` | Current `capability.evidence` records; filter by capability, model, machine, runtime profile, minimum confidence. A **collection** envelope (`items`/`page`) whose items are SetSpec envelopes. `user.*` records carry `goal_hash`, `score_method_mix`, `judge_set`, `calibration` and `judge_validity_factor` ([ADR-0032 §5](../../adr/0032-judge-validity-and-user-capability-namespace.md)) |
| `GET /evidence/export` | A complete `benchmark.evidence_bundle` (SetSpec-versioned), optionally filtered; the file form of the same data. A **single** SetSpec envelope, with no collection wrapper |

The two envelopes compose in exactly that order and never the reverse
([ADR-0025 §2](../../adr/0025-envelope-boundaries.md)). Consumers check `schema_version` and reject
unsupported majors. These endpoints are **read-only** and require only the `read` scope when
authentication is enabled.

### `GET /evidence` parameters

| Parameter | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `capability` | Exact capability ID, e.g. `tool_use` or `user.house_voice` |
| `model` | Model canonical ID, ULID or unambiguous prefix — the same four forms every surface accepts |
| `machine` | Machine fingerprint |
| `runtime_profile` | Runtime profile hash |
| `min_confidence` | Records at or above this confidence |
| `limit`, `cursor` | Cursor pagination over the total order `(capability_id, id)`; `limit` defaults to 50 and clamps to 500 |

A capability with no evidence is **absent** from the collection, never present with a score of
zero, and a goal below its calibration gate has no record at all
([ADR-0032 §3](../../adr/0032-judge-validity-and-user-capability-namespace.md)). The page form,
`/evidence`, shows the same records with ADR-0017's staleness badge and, one interaction away, the
six confidence factors and the contributing metrics that explain each score.

The collection carries both beside `items`: `explanations`, one entry per item in the same order,
each `capability_id`, `staleness` (`stale`, `freshness_factor`, `age_days`, `drift`, `reasons` — the
page's badge, computed as of the request under FreeWeight's own policy) and `confidence_factors`
(the factors the confidence was computed from, as stored). Beside the envelopes rather than inside
them: a record's envelope is the SetSpec document LoadCoach imports, and staleness is a reading of
it at one instant, not part of it.

### `GET /evidence/export` parameters

| Parameter | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `since` | RFC 3339. Returns evidence whose **`computed_at`** is later, on FreeWeight's clock. A client never supplies its own clock: it sends back the `generated_at` of the bundle it received last time, which makes the comparison single-clock and correct across machines |
| `capability`, `model`, `machine`, `runtime_profile`, `min_confidence` | The same filters as `GET /evidence` |

Every bundle declares `complete: true|false`. `since` — or any filter — produces an incremental
bundle (`complete: false`), which can add and update evidence but can never tell a consumer that
something was removed; only a bundle nothing narrowed is complete. A consumer observes removals only from a complete bundle, and marks locally-held evidence
absent from one as `superseded` rather than deleting it
([ADR-0022 §5](../../adr/0022-capability-evidence-record-contract.md)). A consumer that has never
imported from this source pulls complete.

## 7. Database management

| Endpoint | Notes |
|---|---|
| `GET /database/stats` | Row counts, size, revision, last backup, integrity status |
| `POST /database/delete-preview` | Body describes the selection; returns exactly what would be removed, by table |
| `DELETE /database/results` | Requires the preview token returned above; transactional; auto-backup above threshold |
| `POST /database/backup` · `POST /database/vacuum` | Both return an outcome record |

Models and machines are never removed by a result deletion.

## 8. Settings

| Endpoint | Notes |
|---|---|
| `GET /settings` · `PUT /settings` | Runtime-changeable settings only. Attempts to change a security-relevant setting return 403 `FORBIDDEN` naming the config-only key |

The body carries the same answer twice
([ADR-0102](../../adr/0102-freeweights-settings-body-gains-the-suites-shape.md)):

* `settings` — `key -> the value work started from now on will use` — and `definitions`, one entry
  per key carrying `type`, `description`, `minimum`, `maximum`, `unit`, `choices`, `env_var`, the
  `configured` value, the `stored` row (or `null`), `source` (`"database"` when the row is what
  the next run will use, else `"configuration"`) and `shadowed_by` (`"env FREEWEIGHT_…"` naming
  the variable that beats the row, else `null`). This is LoadCoach's and PromptCadence's shape,
  field for field, so one operator reads one vocabulary across all three consoles.
* `items` — the original list, with `value`, `stored_value`, `source` (`"env"` / `"database"` /
  `"file or default"`) and `overridden_by_env`. **Deprecated**, unchanged, and removed when
  FreeWeight next has an `/api/v2`; ADR-0013 permits adding inside a major version, not replacing.
  Note that `items[*].value` reports the value folded in when the process **started**, while
  `settings` applies the stored row at read time — for a key changed since startup the two differ,
  and `settings` is the one that answers "what will the next run use".

`config_only` lists the security-relevant keys the endpoint refuses by name, in both renderings.

**"Applies to work started from now on" is exact, and narrower than it sounds.** A stored value is
read when the application builds the sampler and the scheduler, so it is in force from the next
start. It does **not** re-interval a telemetry sampler that is already running, and it does not
re-read execution defaults between two runs of a serving process.

That is the safe direction to be wrong in: changing a measurement's conditions while it is being
measured is worse than a setting that takes effect later. A run's effective configuration is frozen
at creation and recorded, so a reader can always see which values a given run was measured under —
including the sampler interval.

## 8a. Provider

`GET /provider`, `PUT /provider` — the `[provider]` block, read from and written to the
configuration file itself
([ADR-0117](../../adr/0117-provider-registrations-are-edited-in-place-in-the-config-file.md)).
FreeWeight has one provider, not a registry (spec §12), so there is one block and nothing to name.

`GET` returns the block, the file it lives in, that file's digest, and `shadowed_by` — the
`FREEWEIGHT_PROVIDER__*` variable, if any, that beats the file. A write edits **only** that block:
the file is round-tripped with comments, key order and formatting intact, the candidate document is
validated by loading it through the ordinary precedence chain, the previous file is kept as
`config.toml.bak`, and the provider handle is re-opened so the change applies to work started from
now on. Nothing else this process read at startup is re-read.

Refusals: `400 VALIDATION_ERROR` names a key outside the provider block or a value the provider
model rejects; `409 CONFLICT` means the file changed since `base_digest` was read, and nothing was
written.

## 9. Authentication

Loopback with no configured tokens: open. Otherwise `Authorization: Bearer <token>` with scopes
`read` / `write` / `admin` ([ADR-0014](../../adr/0014-authentication-strategy.md)). Read-only
endpoints — including `/evidence` — need only `read`.

## 10. Client guidance for LoadCoach

1. `GET /api/v1/version` (no credential needed); verify the API major and the
   `benchmark.evidence_bundle` schema versions.
2. `GET /api/v1/evidence/export?since=<the previous bundle's `generated_at`>` for an incremental
   bundle. Never send your own clock. Pull complete on first contact and whenever you need to observe
   removals.
3. Validate the envelope; reject an unsupported major with both versions named.
4. Store evidence keyed by measurement subject — identity, `runtime_profile_hash`,
   `machine_fingerprint`, capability and `policy_version` — and never merge across differing benchmark
   versions, dataset hashes or prompt subset hashes.
4a. Evidence for a model you have not discovered is normal, not an error: retain it, mark it
   unmatched, and bind it when discovery produces a match
   ([ADR-0022 §4](../../adr/0022-capability-evidence-record-contract.md)).
4b. Take freshness from `measured_at`, never from `computed_at`.
4c. Use evidence only for an execution whose resolved runtime profile hash matches the evidence's
   ([ADR-0023](../../adr/0023-runtime-profile-resolution.md)).
4d. Never merge across differing `goal_hash` or judge set identity — both are hard separations
   ([ADR-0032 §4](../../adr/0032-judge-validity-and-user-capability-namespace.md)).
4e. **`user.*` capabilities are opt-in.** Do not weight one unless a task profile names it
   explicitly. A capability that one person's taste defines must not acquire routing influence
   merely by existing.
4f. When a routing decision used a `user.*` capability, the explanation names the goal, its
   agreement (`kappa_w`) and `n_holdout` — in words, not just a confidence number. "Chose qwen3:14b
   partly on `user.house_voice` 0.74, judge agreement 0.71 over 6 samples you graded on 2026-08-14"
   is auditable; "confidence 0.31" is not.
5. Treat FreeWeight being unreachable as **degraded**: keep the last import, mark it stale, and say so
   in every routing explanation.

## 11. Error codes and HTTP statuses

Every non-2xx response uses the one error envelope from
[API Standards §4](../../standards/api-and-contract-standards.md) — `{"error": {"code", "message",
"details", "request_id", "timestamp"}}` — never wrapped in a SetSpec envelope, because an error
describes one request rather than a document that outlives it
([ADR-0025](../../adr/0025-envelope-boundaries.md)).

The codes are listed in [spec §13](spec.md); this is the status each one carries.

| Status | Codes |
|---|---|
| 400 | `VALIDATION_ERROR`, `SCHEMA_VERSION_UNSUPPORTED`, `GOAL_INVALID`, `GOAL_PACK_INCOMPATIBLE`, `GOAL_PATH_UNSAFE`, `GOAL_HASH_MISMATCH`, `COMPARISON_REFUSED` |
| 401 | `UNAUTHENTICATED` |
| 403 | `FORBIDDEN`, `REMOTE_JUDGE_NOT_PERMITTED` |
| 404 | `NOT_FOUND`, `MODEL_NOT_FOUND`, `RUN_NOT_FOUND`, `BENCHMARK_NOT_FOUND`, `GOAL_NOT_FOUND`, `COMPARISON_SUBJECT_NOT_FOUND` |
| 405 | `METHOD_NOT_ALLOWED` |
| 409 | `CONFLICT`, `RUN_NOT_CANCELLABLE`, `RUN_ALREADY_RUNNING`, `RUN_NOT_GRADEABLE`, `CALIBRATION_REQUIRED`, `CALIBRATION_INSUFFICIENT`, `JUDGE_SELF_JUDGING_REFUSED`, `PROMPT_OVERRIDE_REFUSED`, `CONTEXT_FIT_REQUIRED` (a run of a model with no applicable `native.context_fit`, ADR-0148 §5), `DRAFT_REFUSED` |
| 413 | `PAYLOAD_TOO_LARGE` |
| 415 | `UNSUPPORTED_MEDIA_TYPE` |
| 421 | `MISDIRECTED_REQUEST` |
| 500 | `CONFIGURATION_ERROR`, `INTERNAL_ERROR` |
| 502 | `PROVIDER_PROTOCOL_ERROR` |
| 503 | `DEPENDENCY_UNAVAILABLE`, `PROVIDER_UNAVAILABLE`, `JUDGE_UNAVAILABLE` |
| 504 | `PROVIDER_TIMEOUT` |

Three of these are worth a client's attention because the obvious reading is wrong:

* **`403 FORBIDDEN` from `PUT /settings`** is not an authentication failure. It means the key is
  config-only — a security-relevant setting that a running process may not change — and the response
  names the key. Re-authenticating will not help; editing the configuration file will.
* **`409 CALIBRATION_INSUFFICIENT` is not the gate.** It means fewer than `min_samples` grades exist,
  so agreement has never been measured. A goal that *failed* the gate returns `200`.
* **`503 JUDGE_UNAVAILABLE` is a run-level outcome, not an outage.** No jury could be assembled;
  rule criteria still scored and the partial result says so.

## 11a. One name per concept

A metric value's key is **`metric_key`** on every surface that reports one — `GET /results`,
`GET /results/export`, `GET /runs/{id}`, `GET /models/{ref}/results` and `freeweight run show
--json`. It was briefly `key` on two of them, which is exactly the drift CLAUDE.md's "same concept,
same name" rule exists to prevent; a contract test now fails the build if a surface spells it the
old way.

A benchmark **manifest** spells it the same way: `metrics: [{"metric_key": …, "unit": …}]`
([benchmark catalogue](benchmark-catalog.md) §5). Declaring a metric and reporting a value for one
are different acts, and they name the thing identically — so a reader moving between a manifest and
a result never has to translate.

## 12. Exported document schemas

| Schema | Owner | Emitted by |
|---|---|---|
| `benchmark.result`, `benchmark.run_summary` | SetSpec | Embedded in exports and evidence |
| `capability.evidence`, `benchmark.evidence_bundle` | SetSpec | `GET /evidence`, `GET /evidence/export` |
| `benchmark.goal_pack`, `benchmark.calibration_report` | SetSpec | `GET /goals/{slug}/export`, `GET /goals/{slug}/calibration/report` |
| **`freeweight.export`** | **FreeWeight** | `GET /results/export`, `freeweight results export` |

`freeweight.export` is an **application-owned document**, in FreeWeight's own namespace because
SetSpec does not describe it and must not have to: its shape follows this endpoint's query model
(`scope`, `include_samples`, `include_prompts`), and no shared schema can carry keyed metric rows or
raw samples ([ADR-0035](../../adr/0035-application-owned-document-schemas.md)). It **embeds** a real
`benchmark.run_summary` per run under `summary`, so the shared contract is exercised rather than
paraphrased.

It is not a cross-application contract. A consumer integrating with FreeWeight uses the evidence
bundle (§6, §10), which is versioned for exactly that purpose.
