# IdeaPress — Specification

**Type:** Application · **Import/distribution name:** `ideapress` · **Default port:** 8767 · **Env prefix:** `IDEAPRESS_`
**Status:** Specified, not implemented. Corrected 2026-08-21 by the
[final architecture audit](../../reviews/final_architecture_audit.md) (ADR-0025, ADR-0026).
**Related:** [Workflows](workflows.md) · [API](api.md) · [Data Model](data-model.md) · [Development Plan](development-plan.md) · [Risks](risks.md)

---

## 1. Purpose

Turn an idea into finished content through configurable workflows in which **Python owns the control
flow and models perform bounded tasks**. Every stage output is validated deterministically before it
is committed; a model never decides that the work is done.

IdeaPress must be fully useful on its own, against a plain Ollama installation, and must get better —
without any workflow code changing — when LoadCoach is available.

## 2. Scope

* Projects: a source idea, its brief, its plan, its units and its state.
* Workflows: ordered, configurable stages with gates between them.
* Requirement compilation: author intent → machine-checkable, identified, blocking requirements.
* Generation, validation, audit, revision and commit per unit.
* Content types: article and report at 1.0; the registry is open.
* Inference abstraction with three backends: direct Ollama, LoadCoach, OpenAI-compatible.
* Exports: Markdown, HTML, JSON at 1.0.
* Web UI, CLI, project storage, and a local API.

## 3. Explicit non-goals

* **No benchmarking.** IdeaPress never measures model capability; if it wants evidence, LoadCoach has
  it.
* **No routing algorithms.** Standalone mode uses explicitly configured models per stage. Intelligent
  selection is LoadCoach's job and is optional.
* **Never requires FreeWeight.** Not at install, not at runtime, not for any feature.
* Never requires LoadCoach. It is an optional backend.
* No autonomous agent loop; no unbounded model-directed iteration.
* No publishing to third-party platforms at 1.0 (export to file only).
* No collaborative multi-user editing.
* No execution of model-generated code, ever.

## 4. Responsibilities

| Area | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| Projects | Creation, brief, plan, units, state, history, resumption |
| Workflows | Stage definitions, ordering, gates, retries, bounded revision loops |
| Requirements | Compilation from author material; identity; blocking vs advisory; propagation to every stage |
| Generation | One bounded model task per stage attempt, through the inference port |
| Validation | Deterministic checks first; structural, requirement coverage, reference integrity |
| Audit and critique | Model-assisted review that *reports*; the writer stage repairs |
| Revision | Bounded rounds with a diminishing-returns stop; "leave it alone" is a valid verdict |
| Commit | Atomic write of a validated unit with full provenance |
| Export | Deterministic rendering to the supported formats |
| Backends | One inference port, three adapters, switchable by configuration alone |

## 5. Dependencies

**Suite:** `baseaicore`, `setspec`, `modelrack`, `weightsdb`, `mirrorwall`, `cutctx` (the context
reduction seam, [ADR-0104](../../adr/0104-an-adopted-reductions-seam-and-error-vocabulary-survive-it.md)),
`loadledger[sql]` and `commissioner[sql]` (the two mounted tables, row J1,
[ADR-0103](../../adr/0103-ideapress-reacts-to-a-verdict-it-does-not-own.md)), and — since 1.4 —
`toolyard`, which is how the `research` stage fetches and reads
([ADR-0116](../../adr/0116-research-runs-under-toolyard-and-fetches-only-a-named-host.md)).
Optional extra: `sweatmeter` — a presence probe only. IdeaPress shows no machine telemetry
([ADR-0115](../../adr/0115-ideapress-shows-no-machine-telemetry.md)); installing it makes
`INSUFFICIENT_VRAM` (§13) reachable, nothing more.
**Third party:** `fastapi`, `uvicorn[standard]`, `typer`, `pydantic`,
`sqlalchemy`, `alembic`, `jinja2`, `python-multipart` (HTML form posts, which
[ADR-0020](../../adr/0020-ui-rendering-strategy.md) makes the primary UI mechanism), `httpx`
(LoadCoach adapter).
**External services:** an inference backend — Ollama by default, or LoadCoach, or any
OpenAI-compatible endpoint.

**Required at startup:** none. IdeaPress starts, opens projects and exports existing content with no
backend reachable.

## 6. Consumers

Users, via web UI and CLI. IdeaPress exposes a local API for its own UI and for scripting; it is not
designed as a service other applications depend on.

## 7. Public APIs

### 7.1 HTTP (`/api/v1`, detail in [API](api.md))

```

## 8. Inputs

The idea and brief; author material (style guide, audience, constraints, source documents); workflow
selection and configuration; per-stage model bindings (standalone) or task-profile mappings
(LoadCoach); prompts; configuration.

## 9. Outputs

Compiled requirements; plans; unit drafts with full attempt history; validation and audit reports;
committed units; exported documents; per-unit provenance (backend, model, prompt version, validation
results); events.

## 10. Data ownership

Owns `ideapress.sqlite3`: projects, briefs, plans, units, requirements, stage_runs, attempts,
validations, audits, revisions, drafts, exports, backend_config, settings, since 1.4
`tool_call_records`, and since 1.5 `workflows`. Owns its project artifact directory, including the `sources/` subdirectory an
operator drops research material into. Reads nothing belonging to another application.

`workflows` holds the workflow definitions a project binds to, one row per version, append-only
([ADR-0143](../../adr/0143-a-workflow-is-a-stored-versioned-record-a-project-pins.md), migration
`0014`). `projects.workflow_id`/`workflow_version` have named it since `0001`; until 1.5 there was
nothing to name. Nothing outside IdeaPress writes it — WeightRoomGym's editor is HTTP over
`POST`/`PUT /workflows` like any other client.

`tool_call_records` is ToolYard's record shape in IdeaPress's own table
([ADR-0116](../../adr/0116-research-runs-under-toolyard-and-fetches-only-a-named-host.md), migration
`0010`). ToolYard ships `ToolCallRecord` and one `append` method and owns no data at all — not even
a mountable table, which is what distinguishes it from `loadledger` and `commissioner` below — so
the columns, the migration, the retention and every query over them are IdeaPress's. A row exists
for every research tool call, refused and failed ones included: the table answers "what did this
project try", and one that kept only successes would answer the wrong question. It joins to its
attempt by `attempt_id` and to its egress decision by `invocation_id`.

The `sources` rows the `research` stage writes are the project's own evidence set — the same rows
`fact_check` checks claims against and `export` counts for its grounding statement. A note is a
source, not a second kind of thing.

The adapter columns on `attempts` — `adapter_name`, `adapter_digest`, `subject_canonical_id` — are
**IdeaPress's own data**, written from what LoadCoach's response said answered the request. They are
a copy of a fact, not a view onto LoadCoach's `adapters` table, and IdeaPress has no adapters table
of its own: it does not own the adapter registry and must not cache it
([ADR-0083](../../adr/0083-an-adapter-pin-is-configured-on-by-being-configured.md)).

## 11. Public contracts

> **Two senses of "adapter", said once.** In IdeaPress's own prose an *adapter* has always been an
> implementation of the `InferenceBackend` port — "the LoadCoach adapter", "the Ollama adapter".
> Since 1.1 the word also carries the LoRA sense, because that is what LoadCoach's wire and this
> application's configuration call it, and inventing a synonym at the boundary would be worse than
> the ambiguity. Where the two could be read together, this document and
> [Workflows](workflows.md) say **backend** for the port sense and **adapter** for the LoRA sense.
> The port's Python symbols are unchanged.

1. **Backend contract.** The `InferenceBackend` port is IdeaPress-internal but stable: switching
   backends changes configuration only, never workflow code.
2. **Stage contract.** Every stage takes a typed input and returns a typed output plus a validation
   result; no stage returns raw model text to another stage without validation.
3. **Provenance contract.** Every committed unit records backend, model identity, prompt IDs and
   versions, requirement coverage and validation results.
4. **Export contract.** Exports are deterministic: the same committed project exports byte-identically.
5. **LoadCoach contract.** The adapter uses only LoadCoach's documented `/api/v1`, checks version
   compatibility, and degrades explicitly. It sends the rendered prompt as `system` + `prompt`, and
   LoadCoach passes that text to the provider unmodified — which is what keeps the per-attempt
   `prompt_sha256` provenance truthful ([LoadCoach Spec §9](../loadcoach/spec.md)).

## 12. Configuration

```toml

# Standalone stage → model bindings. Ignored in loadcoach mode unless

# Per-stage LoRA adapter pins, sent to LoadCoach as its `adapter` override. Sparse: a stage with no
# key has no pin. A key present is a pin in effect — there is no second boolean, and it does not
# ride `honour_stage_bindings`, whose meaning is "give up routing", which an adapter pin does not
# (ADR-0083). Only in `loadcoach` mode.
[models.stage_adapters]
draft    = "house-voice"
revise   = "terse-editor"

# One key per model-using stage in [Workflows §2](workflows.md), spelled exactly as the stage is.
# A binding for a stage that does not exist, or a model-using stage with no binding, fails startup
# validation naming the stage — the audit found the previous list used `edit` and `audit`, neither of
# which is a stage identifier.
#
`[models.stage_adapters]` keys are spelled exactly as [Workflows §2](workflows.md) spells the
stage, and its values are **LoadCoach's manifest names** — IdeaPress resolves nothing and holds no
registry. Startup refuses a key naming a gate stage or an unknown stage, in the same shape
`[inference.loadcoach] job_stages` refuses one, and refuses **any** key when `[inference] mode` is
not `loadcoach`: the direct and OpenAI-compatible paths are adapter-free by recorded scope decision
([adapter roadmap §4.4](../../roadmap/adapter-roadmap.md)), because an adapter served through an
OpenAI-compatible endpoint would evade identity tracking. A name this LoadCoach does not have is
**not** a startup error — it is `ADAPTER_NOT_FOUND` at run time, listing what does exist, because
the list is LoadCoach's and caching it here would be a second registry that drifts.

Setting a stage in **both** tables with `honour_stage_bindings` on names exactly one subject: the
model pin narrows the field to one base and the adapter pin selects among that base's subjects. That
is the one combination in which an adapter pin surrenders routing, and it does so because the model
pin already did ([ADR-0083](../../adr/0083-an-adapter-pin-is-configured-on-by-being-configured.md)).

`[inference] data_classification` is a statement about the **installation**, not about a stage:
one value to keep correct and one place to audit. It travels on every LoadCoach request, and
LoadCoach records `max(caller, adapter)` on the attempt and in any classification rejection
([ADR-0065](../../adr/0065-an-adapter-is-classified-and-local-only.md) rule 2). Unset means
`public`, the lowest level, so the join equals the adapter's own classification and a `1.0`
configuration behaves exactly as it did. Under-declaration is possible and accepted: the adapter
half still fails closed against a remote registration, which is the invariant that matters.

# `[execution]` is [ADR-0038](../../adr/0038-one-model-at-a-time-per-gpu.md). One model runs at a
# time, never two: `max_concurrent_stages` above 1 is refused at startup with the reason rather than
# clamped, because IdeaPress has no queue and a second concurrent generation means two models
# resident on a single-GPU machine. `unload_before_model_switch = false` lets two models contend for
# one card, which degrades to CPU or OOM with no error the application can raise.

[execution]  max_concurrent_stages = 1        # only 1 is accepted; above 1 is refused at startup
             unload_before_model_switch = true # unload the resident model before loading another

[workflow]   max_revision_rounds = 3   diminishing_returns_threshold = 0.05
             max_attempts_per_stage = 3  audit_escalation_threshold = 0.6
             require_clean_validation_to_commit = true
             allow_audit_gated_requirements = true  # ADR-0039: whether an audit's explicit
                                               # attestation may satisfy a check-less blocking
                                               # requirement; silence never satisfies either way
             structured_output_tokens = 8192   # output budget for the structured stages
                                               # (requirements, outline, audits, critique,
                                               # project review); raised above 8192 it also
                                               # lifts the draft/repair/revise thinking floor;
                                               # accepted range 1024-131072
# `[research]` is the `research` stage's whole configuration (ADR-0116). Every default is closed:
# `allowed_hosts` empty means `http_fetch` is not registered at all — not ToolYard's own "empty
# means loopback", which for this application would let a URL in a brief reach a service on the
# user's own machine. `max_data_classification` unset means a remote host is *denied*, fail closed,
# the same rule `[inference.loadcoach] max_data_classification` follows (ADR-0103 decision 2).
[research]   allowed_tools = ["http_fetch", "read_file"]
             allowed_hosts = []          # no host, so a fresh install fetches nothing
             max_fetch_bytes = 1048576   # per fetched document
             max_file_bytes = 1048576    # per file read from the project's sources/ directory
             timeout_seconds = 30.0      # per tool call
             max_data_classification = ""   # public | internal | confidential; empty denies remote

[providers]  allow_remote = false
[logging]    level = "INFO"  include_content = false
```

`[research] allowed_tools` is the executor's **allowlist**, not the registry: a name it omits is
refused `not_allowlisted`, and a name it contains that could not be built — `http_fetch` with no
host — is refused `unknown_tool`. Both are recorded results, never startup failures, because a
server that will not boot tells an operator less than a row naming what was withheld and why
([ADR-0053](../../adr/0053-a-refused-tool-call-is-a-result-not-an-exception.md) decision 1: a
handler is registered in code or not at all, so no configuration could ever supply one). A name
that is not one of the two shipped tools is refused at startup, because it can only be a typo.

Stage → LoadCoach task profile mapping lives in the adapter, in one place
([Workflows §6](workflows.md)), never scattered through workflow code.

## 13. Error behaviour

```text
BACKEND_UNAVAILABLE        VALIDATION_FAILED          PROJECT_NOT_FOUND
BACKEND_VERSION_MISMATCH   REQUIREMENTS_UNMET         UNIT_NOT_FOUND
MODEL_NOT_CONFIGURED       STAGE_PRECONDITION_FAILED  STAGE_ALREADY_RUNNING
PROVIDER_TIMEOUT           REVISION_LIMIT_REACHED     EXPORT_FAILED
CONTEXT_LIMIT_EXCEEDED     CONTENT_REJECTED           SCHEMA_VERSION_UNSUPPORTED
INSUFFICIENT_VRAM          ADAPTER_NOT_FOUND          ADAPTER_PROFILE_MISMATCH
```

Behavioural rules:
* A failed stage **pauses the project at that stage**; committed units are untouched and the stage is
  resumable.
* A stage never commits an output that failed a blocking validation.
* Revision stops at the configured round limit or when improvement falls below the diminishing-returns
  threshold, and records which stop applied.
* `CONTENT_REJECTED` (a model refusing the task) is a distinct outcome from a failure, and is
  surfaced with the model's stated reason.
* Backend unavailable: fall back if configured and not pinned; otherwise fail the stage clearly.
* `ADAPTER_NOT_FOUND` and `ADAPTER_PROFILE_MISMATCH` are the two refusals of a
  `[models.stage_adapters]` pin, raised from LoadCoach's own `ADAPTER_NOT_FOUND` and
  `PROFILE_MISMATCH`. **Both fail the stage; neither degrades to the bare base**
  ([ADR-0064](../../adr/0064-adapters-are-selected-through-the-capability-vocabulary.md) rule 4). An
  operator who pinned a house-voice adapter and got the base's prose back has been lied to about
  what produced their document, and that is the one thing this application's provenance story
  cannot allow. Both are **permanent for the request as written**, so neither is retried: the pin
  has to change, or the adapter has to be registered. `ADAPTER_NOT_FOUND` carries the names
  LoadCoach does have, so the message says what to write instead.
* **A refused research tool call is not an error code and never appears in the table above**
  ([ADR-0053](../../adr/0053-a-refused-tool-call-is-a-result-not-an-exception.md),
  [ADR-0116](../../adr/0116-research-runs-under-toolyard-and-fetches-only-a-named-host.md)). A host
  outside the allowlist, a denied egress verdict, a path escaping the project's `sources/`
  directory, a document over the byte cap, an origin that is down — every one of them is a
  `toolyard.ToolResult` with a status and a machine-readable reason, recorded as a
  `tool_call_records` row and shown on the unit page. The stage completes; the note is simply not
  written. The attempt for such a call records `outcome = "refused"` (or `provider_error` /
  `timeout` for the two ToolYard statuses that mean the world answered badly rather than a rule
  saying no), which is what makes the refusal legible from the attempt alone.
* `INSUFFICIENT_VRAM` is the wait-or-refuse outcome of
  [ADR-0038](../../adr/0038-one-model-at-a-time-per-gpu.md): the preflight found less free VRAM than
  the configured model needs with room for its context. It carries **both figures** — required and
  available — because a refusal without them is indistinguishable from a crash, and it is a distinct
  outcome from `BACKEND_UNAVAILABLE`, which means the backend did not answer at all. It is raised
  only where telemetry is available (`ideapress[telemetry]`); without it the serialise-and-unload
  invariant holds on its own and this code never appears.

## 14. Security considerations

* Loopback default; LAN exposure requires tokens, acknowledgement and `server.allowed_hosts`; the
  `Host` header is validated on every request before routing. This is the application holding the
  user's private work, and an unauthenticated loopback service is reachable from any page the user
  visits without that check ([ADR-0026](../../adr/0026-local-http-hardening.md)).
* **Model output is never executed**, never used to build a path, never rendered unescaped. Markdown
  is sanitized with an allowlist.
* Project and export paths are containment-checked; project IDs and unit IDs are validated against a
  strict pattern before touching the filesystem.
* Imported project archives are hardened against traversal, symlinks and decompression bombs.
* Prompts and drafts are the user's content: stored locally, never uploaded, never logged at INFO or
  above.
* Remote backends require explicit opt-in and are labelled as egress in the UI, per stage.
* **A browser click may cause a network fetch, and the page says where it can go.** The workspace's
  "Run research" form starts the one stage that fetches; it reaches only a host named in
  `[research] allowed_hosts`, the list is printed beside the button, and an empty list means no
  fetch leaves the machine. Every attempt's egress decision is shown on the unit page's Provenance
  table (row N2).
* `include_content` logging is off by default.

## 15. Performance considerations

Model time dominates; IdeaPress's own budgets:

| Measure | Target |
|---|---|
| Stage orchestration overhead (excluding inference) | ≤ 50 ms per attempt |
| Validation of a 5 000-word unit | ≤ 200 ms |
| Project load (100 units) | ≤ 300 ms |
| Export of a 100-unit project to Markdown | ≤ 2 s |
| Export of a 100-unit project to HTML | ≤ 5 s |
| Editor page render | ≤ 300 ms |
| Draft autosave round-trip | ≤ 100 ms |

Long documents stream to disk rather than being held in memory more than once.

**Output-token budgets include the model's reasoning.** A thinking model spends output tokens on
its reasoning before the first word of its answer, from the same allowance — measured on the
reference machine, `qwen3.5:9b-q8_0` compiling requirements from a six-line brief produced nothing
at all at 4 096 tokens and finished in 278 tokens of answer at 8 192. The structured stages
therefore run under `workflow.structured_output_tokens` (default 16384, range 1024–131072), which is
configuration rather than a constant: a model that thinks longer than the reference machine's
exhausts the budget with empty output, and the user's lever for that is `config.toml`, not a code
edit. The text-writing stages (draft, repair, revise) budget a thinking floor plus four tokens per
target word, and the floor is the larger of the measured 8192 and the same setting — so one knob is
the lever for every empty-generation pause, whichever stage hits it. **The default is 16384 because
the widest shipped prompt needs it** (row WPF7): the 8192 below is the *draft* floor, and a five-unit
`project_review` on `qwen3.5:9b-q8_0` spent about 11 800 output tokens reasoning before its first
word — measured at an 8 792-token budget, a draft's first call after a cold load spent every one of
them thinking and returned nothing, which is the retry's own reason for existing. A unit that exhausts an output
budget twice **pauses with the stage and the budget in the reason** while the remaining units
continue; it never aborts the stage.

**The output budget is spent from the same window as the prompt, so the served context is the
figure that decides whether a stage can answer at all** (row WPF7). A local server serves a fixed
context length, and the prompt, the reasoning and the answer all come out of it: raising
`structured_output_tokens` above what the window leaves cannot be honoured, because `num_predict`
cannot exceed the room the prompt left. WP6 met every consequence of that on the reference machine,
where Ollama served 8 192 tokens (`OLLAMA_CONTEXT_LENGTH`, the operator's memory cap,
[ADR-0119](../../adr/0119-model-servers-run-under-a-host-memory-cap.md) decision 1): `project_review`
assembled a 12 777-token context under its 24 000-token budget — which the server truncated — and
two units paused, each after two calls that spent the whole window reasoning and returned nothing.
The measurements, all on `qwen3.5:9b-q8_0`, same machine, 2026-09-11:

| Stage | Prompt | Reasoning before the first word | Answer |
|---|---|---|---|
| `critique`, short unit | 2 289 | ≈ 1 700 | 237 characters |
| `critique`, long unit | 4 723 | ≈ 4 300 | 334 characters |
| `audit_fast`, long unit | 5 581 | ≈ 4 300 | 287 characters |
| `revise` | 538 | ≈ 5 300 – 7 000 | ≈ 900 characters |
| `project_review`, five units | 12 777 | ≈ 11 800 | 1 757 characters |

So IdeaPress **states the window it needs and checks its budgets against it**:
`inference.ollama.served_context_tokens` (default 32768) is sent as `num_ctx` on every request — one
value for every stage, because Ollama reloads a model when a request asks for a different context
length — and a stage whose assembled-context budget, output budget and prompt overhead exceed it is
**refused before the run**, naming all four numbers. `0` leaves the server's own default and turns
the check off, because a check with no figure to check against would be a guess. IdeaPress never
raises the window on its own: how large a window the card can hold is the operator's memory decision
(ADR-0119 decision 3), and the host cap is what keeps a large one safe. On the reference card a
9.7B Q8_0 model at 32 768 tokens holds 11.6 GB of 16 GB.

**A budget large enough for most prompts is not large enough for a reasoning loop**, so the retry
of an empty generation asks for the answer *without* reasoning where the backend can carry that
(workflows §6.2). Measured: `project_review` on two committed units produced nothing in 16 384 tokens
twice, 375 seconds a call, on a served window of 32 768 — the model was not short of room, it was not
stopping.

`project_review_context_budget_tokens` defaults to **14336** for the same reason: with the
16384-token output budget and the prompt it fits the default window (14 336 + 16 384 + 512 = 31 232),
where the previous 24 000 fitted nothing IdeaPress asks to be served. A five-unit document measured
12 777 tokens, so it still fits without compaction.

## 16. Cross-platform considerations

Fully portable — no platform-specific code beyond the shared path handling. IdeaPress shows no
machine telemetry ([ADR-0115](../../adr/0115-ideapress-shows-no-machine-telemetry.md)), so there is
no display to degrade; IdeaPress is the most likely component to be used on Windows or macOS, which
is why it takes no hard dependency on `sweatmeter` regardless.

## 17. Observability

* Structured logs with `request_id`, `project_id`, `unit_id`, `stage`, `attempt`, `backend`,
  `model_canonical_id`.
* Persisted stage events with SSE replay, so a long stage survives a refresh.
* Health components: `database`, `backend` (naming which one and its reachability), `prompts`.
* Every unit's history shows every attempt, its validations, its audits and what changed.

## 18. Test strategy

| Layer | Coverage |
|---|---|
| Unit | Requirement compilation; every validator; revision-stop logic; diminishing-returns detection; stage state machine; export rendering |
| Contract | Backend port conformance for all three adapters; LoadCoach API version negotiation; SetSpec envelopes |
| Integration | Full workflow against `FakeProvider`; project persistence; resumption after a failed stage; migrations both dialects |
| E2E | Idea → plan → draft → audit → revise → commit → export, over HTTP and CLI |
| Backend-parity | **The same workflow run against all three backends produces the same structure**, with only content differing |
| Failure-path | Backend down mid-stage; LoadCoach version mismatch; validation failure; revision limit; refusal; context overflow; disk full mid-export |
| Security | No execution of model output; sanitized rendering; traversal; archive hardening |
| Performance | Every budget in §15 |
| Live (marked) | Real Ollama and real LoadCoach: one short project end to end |

## 19. Compatibility and versioning

* Application semver; API `v1`; workflows and content types versioned independently.
* A project records the workflow version it was created with; a workflow upgrade never rewrites
  committed units.
* Prompt versions recorded per attempt; changing a prompt does not alter existing units.
* **An operator's prompt override** (prompt standards §6, row W9) — a whole record at
  `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/ideapress/prompts/<prompt_id>.json` — replaces the shipped record of the same
  `prompt_id` when IdeaPress starts, and every attempt that rendered it records
  `prompt_source: user_override` beside its prompt version and hash. `prompts list|show --shipped`
  print the pack as installed. A per-*project* override is still a future extension (§21).
* Export format changes are versioned; re-export of an old project is byte-stable for its recorded
  version.
* **What 1.1 adds, and what it does not break.** `[models.stage_adapters]` and
  `[inference] data_classification` are both additions with defaults — an empty table and the lowest
  classification — so a shipped `1.0` configuration file loads to a byte-identical settings object
  and produces byte-identical requests but for the classification field, which joins to the same
  effective value it had when it was absent. No existing key changes meaning, no default moves, and
  the three columns migration `0006` adds to `attempts` are nullable with no back-fill: rows written
  before it are base subjects and read as such.
* **A 1.1 field is only sent to a LoadCoach that has it.** `overrides.adapter` and
  `data_classification` are 1.1 fields on a body that forbids unknown ones. Against a LoadCoach
  older than 1.1, IdeaPress **refuses** any request that would need one — a pinned stage, or a
  declared classification above the default — with `BACKEND_VERSION_MISMATCH` naming both versions,
  rather than sending it to be 422'd or, worse, dropping it and under-declaring silently. An
  installation with no pins and the default classification is 1.0 traffic and keeps working
  unchanged.

## 20. Acceptance criteria

1. `pip install ideapress && ideapress serve` produces finished content with **only Ollama** present —
   no LoadCoach, no FreeWeight, no configuration beyond stage model bindings.
2. Switching `inference.mode` between `ollama`, `loadcoach` and `openai_compatible` requires **no
   workflow code change** — proven by the backend-parity test.
3. No model output can end a gated stage: a "this is fine, stop" response does not satisfy a gate.
4. Every stage output passes deterministic validation before commit.
5. A failed or cancelled stage leaves committed units intact and is resumable.
6. Every committed unit records backend, model, prompt versions, requirement coverage and validation
   results.
7. LoadCoach unavailable ⇒ configured fallback or a clear error; **never a startup failure**.
8. IdeaPress imports nothing from FreeWeight or LoadCoach (asserted by import-linter).
9. Exports are deterministic and byte-stable for the same committed project.
10. Model output containing scripts, template syntax or path traversal is stored and rendered inert.
11. Full test suite passes with no backend reachable and no network.
12. All IdeaPress gold standards in [Gold Standards §2](../../standards/gold-standards.md) are met.

## 21. Future extensions

* More content types (novel, narrative pack, documentation set) via the existing registry.
* More export formats (PDF, EPUB, DOCX).
* Failure memory — remembering what previously failed for a project so retries avoid it.
* Concept competition — generating several execution approaches and selecting among them.
* ~~Research backends (local document ingestion; opt-in web search).~~ **Built at 1.4**
  ([ADR-0116](../../adr/0116-research-runs-under-toolyard-and-fetches-only-a-named-host.md)):
  `read_file` over the project's `sources/` directory and `http_fetch` over an operator-named host
  list, both through ToolYard's executor. What is still future here is anything that decides its
  own targets — following a link out of a fetched document, paginating a result set, or a search
  engine of any kind.
* Per-project prompt overrides with the same record schema and hashing.
* Publishing integrations (explicitly opt-in, clearly marked as egress).
* Using LoadCoach's reliability data to inform stage-level model hints.
